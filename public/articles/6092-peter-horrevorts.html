Speelt Saturday 13 September op The city is yours: Afterparty Paard van Troje.</p><p></p>


	<p>In his early youth, Peter&#8217;s creativity was focused on drawing, painting and sculpting. His passion for music was inspired by the wide variety of sounds played at home by his music loving mother.
His interest developed further when he encountered the electronic sounds of the late 80&#8217;s and amongst his favourite artists and bands were Depeche Mode, New Order, Yello, Ultravox and also Michael Jackson.</p>


	<p>At the beginning of the 90&#8217;s the then &#8216;unusual&#8217; style of techno captured his imagination and he realised that here was a sound he&#8217;d been searching for. The futuristic themes matched his interests in science fiction and the rhythmic structures of techno, unlike any other music before, made him feel like dancing.
He was fascinated by all of the new, previously unheard sounds and was keen to understand how to create them.
Soon, he&#8217;d bought his own computer, learned about music programs and eagerly set about making his own music. After years of experimentation and a long search for his own sound, he made his first digital release on Sublogic Corporation, a digital record label.
The positive reaction to the release, encouraged him to circulate a few demo’s and within 2 weeks he&#8217;d signed his first contract with Dj Misjah’s X-Trax Records.</p>


	<p>In 2001 he released his first record; “Sweets EP” on X-trax under his guise “Forcesupreme”. His unique, bombastic and energetic style were highly appreciated by DJ’s like Marco Carola, Carl Cox and Adam Beyer.</p>


	<p>Currently, the young talent has records released through X-trax, Tsunami, and Phonocult and has remixed work from artists such as Ferry Corsten, Dj Misjah and Melvin Reese. A pretty impressive discography for a guy of his years.</p>http://www.forcesupreme.com/
