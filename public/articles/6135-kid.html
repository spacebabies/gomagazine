Speelt Friday 17 October op Innovation 2 Years.</p><p>  Without a shadow of a doubt, Kid&#8217;s contribution to the music&#8217;s development in Scotland is extremely significant, and without his continued efforts, it is questionable whether the Scottish drum &#38; bass scene would be anywhere near the healthy condition it presently enjoys.  Through 15 years of hard work and sheer determination, Kid has elevated himself from a complete unknown to the well-respected DJ who currently resides at Edinburgh&#8217;s Manga, Scotland&#8217;s longest running and most successful drum &#38; bass event.</p>


	<p>Kid&#8217;s DJ&#8217;ing career started at a time when the rave and happy hardcore sound ruled Scotland &#8217; a scene in which Kid saw no place for himself.  Luckily, he was given a live mix tape featuring <span class="caps">DJ SS</span> and Stu Allan, and, blown away by this brand new style, Kid commenced on his drum &#38; bass odyssey.  In 1992, having regularly tried in vain to introduce groundbreaking music from labels such as Ibiza, Reinforced, and Formation, and with the vast majority of Scottish clubbers unable to get to grips with the emerging breakbeat sound, Kid began to feel he had no other option than to focus his attentions south of the border where the breakbeat scene was rapidly gaining popularity.  Kid&#8217;s decision to completely turn his back on the clubs in his home country was sealed by his appearance in a clubs newsletter&#8217;s poll listing DJ&#8217;s not to book.</p>


	<p>Within six months of sending tapes to promoters in England, Kid got his important break with a chance to play the warm up set for DJ Rap and Fabio at Quest in Wolverhampton.  The promoters, suitably impressed, decided to keep him on until the night wound up in 1996 &#8211; an experience that proved to be the solid foundation for Kid&#8217;s career in the breakbeat scene, which shortly thereafter become know as Jungle.</p>


	<p>Between 1992 and 1998 Kid could find himself travelling in excess of 1200 miles in a weekend in order to play to people who appreciated the music he loved, and quickly became a regular feature on line-ups playing not only at Quest, but also for other prestige promoters including Roast, Jungle Fever, One Nation, World Dance and Pandemonium.  Whilst continuing to build his reputation in England, Rotterdam Techno was proving to be the final nail in the coffin of the weary rave scene back in Scotland.  Waiting with anticipation for his opportunity to turn the tables on the Scottish club scene, Kid joined DJ Gmac at the helm of Manga, and has never looked back since.  Coming up for its seventh birthday, Manga is the bedrock of the now thriving Scottish Drum and Bass scene, and it is certain that Kid&#8217;s strong ties with most of the scene&#8217;s main DJ&#8217;s and producers has helped the night achieve its undisputed heavyweight status.</p>


	<p>Over the last six years, Kid has been building on his list of experiences, and at the same time, has made important steps towards recognition outside the UK.  In June &#8216;98 he went to the <span class="caps">USA</span>, playing gigs in Houston, Texas, Akron (Ohio), as well as playing a set for New York&#8217;s foremost drum &#38; Bass record store, Breakbeat Science, on their net radio show &#8216;Velocity.&#8217;  Through his connections with Jungle Fever, Kid has also played in clubs in Hamburg, Manheim and Freiberg, Germany.  Back home in Scotland, Kid continued to push the drum &#38; bass genre, promoting nights including once regular Jungle Magic &#8211; now an outlet for special one-off nights, such as when Hype, Zinc &#38; Pascal played together for the first time in Scotland, the biggest night for Scottish Drum &#38; Bass to date &#8217; and a series of nights from Goldie&#8217;s Metalheadz label, for whom Kid was the Scottish resident.</p>


	<p>In addition to DJ&#8217;ing in clubs, Kid has also made several radio appearances over the years.  Kid&#8217;s airtime includes a live set from Radio One&#8217;s studios on the &#8216;One in the Jungle&#8217; show (now hosted by Fabio and Grooverider) and, through his connections with Jungle Fever, many appearances on London&#8217;s award winning pirate, Kool FM.  Kid&#8217;s involvement with Quest also saw him playing on the Midland&#8217;s only representing station at the time, Choice FM.  Kid, who has always believed that the radio stations in Scotland have done very little to represent the D &#38; B genre, thought things were changing when he found himself proudly co-presenting Scotland&#8217;s first legal drum &#38; bass radio show on Beat 106.  Unfortunately his feelings about local radio were confirmed for the worse when the station was bought over; the show dropped from the schedule after only 11 months.  Fortunately, net radio station Radio Magnetic has since come into life, and Kid can be heard amongst others representing Manga every Friday on their show, &#8216;Terminal Velocity.&#8217;</p>


	<p>By dedicating his efforts towards the scene&#8217;s development in Scotland, Kid is aware that he&#8217;s had to make sacrifices in his studio time, but feels it&#8217;s more important to first get the ball rolling properly in other Scottish cities; being very protective of the Scottish scene, he does not want to see it spoiled by improper nurturing.</p>


	<p>As such, Kid&#8217;s only finished project to date is a track called &#8216;Invaders,&#8217; written with fellow Manga resident The General, which featured on Formation&#8217;s World of Drum &#38; Bass album.  However, with some tricks up his sleeve, Kid plans to launch his own label, &#8216;Invade Recordings,&#8217; 2004 &#8211; with an &#8216;invasion&#8217; of Scottish produced drum &#38; bass on the world in mind, the label will feature work by other Scottish producers alongside Kid&#8217;s own tracks. Before he launches his own imprint he will launch another label called Restless Natives, which will see talent brought on board from all over the world. The first release by Dj Kryptik  hit the streets back in January 2004 and sold 1000 copies. Both 28 Days and New encounters recived very good support throughout the world. The follow up on the label also by Dj Kryptik was smashed on dub by the likes of Grooverider Bryan G,Dj SS and Simon Bassline Smith to name but a few and was released in the shops in may. After that 12 it was the turn of another newcomer by the name of Dj Samurai Featuring Charlotte. The tune is called &#8216;Dayz&#8217; and has just been released (October 2004)  The 12 also features the first of many big name producers Dj Kid plans to bring into remix material on the label. Peshay one of the scenes true legends has added his musical flavour to the mix and liked the outcome so much he has licensed it from Kid to put as the first track on his forthcoming Jammin LP. Check out www.restlessnatives.co.uk for further details. In February 2005 you can hear the previous releases on the label as well as all the forthcoming material on the front cover cd of Knowledge Magazine which has been arranged and mixed by the label boss himself.</p>


	<p>Over the last ten years, Kid has relayed as much of the best music to Scottish clubbers as he can.  Smashing it wherever he plays, Kid keeps it moving with the latest test presses, regularly sent to him by all of the major labels.  Kid always takes pride in mixing two tunes together &#8211; keeping it tight, at times chopping it up, and occasionally touching on some scratching.  With his unpredictable and versatile style, Kid pushes as many different vibes as possible, always keeping it fresh, and throwing in a couple of classics for the pleasure of old and new skool junglists alike.  A legend in his own right, you can guarantee that as long as there is drum &#38; bass in Scotland, DJ Kid will be there at forefront, driving the scene forward as he always has.</p><div id="liveset" class="uitleg"><p>Fan van Kid?
