Speelt Saturday 09 February op The Beginning.</p><p> In 1988 after living in New York City for a year, Jeroen and Jeff moved to Amsterdam with a crate of records and a drum computer.
Since then Jeroen &#38; Jeff, formed a band (Fierce Ruling Diva) a record label ( Lower East Side records), ran two <span class="caps">INFAMOUS</span> clubs ( Planet E, Subtopia) and a multitude of club nights, the most current being www.clubdivine.nl
<span class="caps">FRD</span> have been producing, recording, remixing, releasing, performing, promoting and spinning since 1989. That&#8217;s a lot of years to remember. As far as our memory still works, here&#8217;s a period overview.</p>


	<p>1986-1989 Background</p>


	<p>In the summer of 1986, Jeff Porter met Jeroen Flamman in a bar in Amsterdam. Jeff was on a tour of Europe after graduating from Boston University where he studied Communications. Jeroen was on a day off from his work as Best Boy for Commercials. A month later both were sharing an apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Jeff got a job on Wall Street, Jeroen started operating Follow-Spots at fashion shows and working as Electrician for non-Union film productions.</p>


	<p>And of course they partied&#8230; Clubs frequently visited included Traxx, Save The Robots. It was a time of changes, a new sound was dominating the dancefloors: Housemusic. Jeroen went out to a small Record Store on Broadway in Williamsburg and bought his very first House record: &#8220;Can You Feel It?&#8221; by Todd Terry.</p>


	<p>Jeff&#8217;s father, James Porter, was running a drive in show in The Bronx and he donated two turntables and a mixing board. And since 12&#8221;s only cost $ 3.69 in those days, Jeff &#38; Jeroen went out and bought all their favorite house tunes, week by week.</p>


	<p>Late 1988 Jeff and Jeroen packed their records, bought an Alesis drum computer and headed back to Amsterdam where they lived in a damp apartment in front a fish market .One Herman Hesse book later Jeff became Abraxas and soon we had our first regular clubnight in a place called <span class="caps">DOK</span>.</p>


	<p>1989 In a home studio in Amsterdam they finished two tracks: I Don&#8217;t Wanna Be A Freak and Feeling Fly. Created their own record label: Lower East Side Records, named after the neighborhood in <span class="caps">NYC</span> where they had lived.</p>


	<p>One thing that we were disappointed about were the closing hours of the clubs an Amsterdam, there was no after hours. One of their favorite groups, New Order, was attending a Hacienda Night in the RoXY and they had a strange plan: they would empty our apartment and throw a &#8220;New Order After Hours&#8221;. They did flyers in the RoXY and guess who were ringing the bell in the wee hours? : Barney, Gillian &#38; Pete from New Order. The party was a big success and we repeated the formula for four weeks before the neighbors rebelled</p>


	<p>Soon after they found an abandoned Sauna, meters away from Central Station. They had the possibility of throwing illegal parties for four weeks, so they continued our after hour entrepreneurship and called it Planet E &#8211; after a house tune by KC Flightt. The following month we discovered an abandoned club. Planet E was officially Holland&#8217;s first 100% House club.</p>


	<p>Fierce Ruling Diva released three 12&#8221;s in 1990 Whipped Kream (The Summer Remixes), Rubb It In and Atomic Slide (You Got To Believe) in 1990. Thanks to licensing deals in America &#38; Belgium all three became not only floorfillers but instant Club classics that are still being licensed and sampled to this very day! even Moby made a mix! New York City was the Spot where <span class="caps">FRD</span> blew up first largely due to Jr. Vasquez&#8217;s working the hell out of Atomic Slide at The Sound Factory Matt Silver (Silver Entertainment) Organized a tour and soon <span class="caps">FRD</span> and dancers where headliners at Clubs &#38; Raves big &#38; small in all four corners of America Highlights (remembered )include shows at Deelite&#8217;s &#8216;Hello&#8217; at Webster Hall, Keoki&#8217;s, &#8216;Disco 2000&#8217; at Limelight; N.A.S.A, The Ritz, <span class="caps">MEAT</span>, Swirl, Palladium &#38; The Pyramid. and Studio 54 Doc Martin&#8217;s R.E.A.L. is San Francisco . We also remember being on stage in Seattle, Columbus, Dallas, Los Angeles. St Louis, Philadelphia, Chicago, Portland, Cleveland, Montreal, Destiny&#8217;s # 3 &#38; 7 in Toronto and Spring Break in San Felipe Mexico See Flyers</p>


	<p>In the same year in the <span class="caps">UK FRD</span> blew up due to &#8216;Rubb It In becoming a Rave anthem. UK gigs include: Heaven, Trade, Universe, <span class="caps">PURE</span>, Nocturnal ,Code Red M.D.S&#8217;s World Party and various Raves in and about the country sides of Northern England and Scotland.</p>


	<p>Explicit lyrics, Over-the -top Rave clothes and half naked dancers held on a leash was the Look on stage and the crowds ate it up. Abraxas works &#38; interacts with the audience, always taking the time to hand out free records, or his hotel keys. With some shows they were joined on stage by the sassy MC Sweet &#38; Lo ( who was Josh Wink&#8217;s girlfriend at he time) It was a whirlwind time with hotels, limos and best off all they got meet all of our favorite producers and DJ&#8217;s. Blake Baxter, Danny Teneglia, Frankie Knuckles, Frankie Bones, Carl Cox, Daz Saund, Lenny Dee, John Aquiviva.</p>


	<p>By the end of that year, Planet E had closed its doors and <span class="caps">FRD</span> were looking for a new location to throw after-hours parties. They stumbled on to a barge, behind Central Station, turned it into a club and started 1 1/2 years of illegal partying. The club was called Subtopia, but was called by many &#8220;Das Boot&#8221;.</p>


	<p>Jeroen started with Dano a new weekly night in The Mazzo: Manic Monday. Since for many DJ&#8217;s and artists Monday was one of their few nights off, it was to become a meeting point for anyone professionally involved in the Housemusic scene. Manic Monday was to last 6 years, until the Mazzo burnt down in 1996. Every month Jeroen was able to invite an international guest. Some very famous people saw their first European gig here at manic Monday. To name a few: Lenny Dee, Ritchie Hawtin, Charly Casanova, Moby, <span class="caps">PCP</span>, Juan Atkins, Nico, Ralphie Dee, Joey Beltram, and <span class="caps">LFO</span></p>


	<p>1993 Abraxas moved to New York City and open Subtopia Record Store in the back Of Liquid Sky, The first attitude-free record store in Manhattan to allow you to play records yourself before buying but got caught in the serious dysfuctianlism between Carlos Soulslinger and Jonathan <span class="caps">XXX</span> &#38; Scott who were silent partners.Who then took over and changed the name to Satellite Records, But not before prompting Aldo Hernandez ( Meat) to open his own record store. The whole New York thing was a debacle best forgotten! Jeff returned to Amsterdam where he and Jeroen reinvented themselves as a hardcore DJ&#8217;s. In 1995 they influenced the sound of European Dance Music <span class="caps">FOREVER</span> by penning the Top ten hit &#8217; I want to be A Hippy&#8217; for their (then) friends Technohead</p>


	<p>1995-1999 The Party Animal, MC Lynx , Double Date Years</p>


	<p>2000-2003 The Diva Rests 
Jeff left Amsterdam for a one year business study at the University of Edinburgh. Jeroen starts producing again. 
React Music re-releases Rubb It In remixes by SuperChumbo which reaches Number one in the Billboard Club Play chart and Jeff &#38; Jeroen produce a single for Oliver Chesler&#8217;s Things To Come Records &#8211; under the name Zero-Killed. Vintage <span class="caps">FRD</span> tracks are being licesenced left , right and center for 10 Year House compilations all over Europe The UK and America</p>
