Speelt Saturday 14 February op Kulturama.</p><p> Deemed the music tastemaker by those in the know, his ear for music paired with his ability to drop party rocking beats has championed dance floors night after night. Whether providing the indie soundtrack to his wildly popular Tuesday night at Cinespace in LA (which also showcases the hippest up-and-coming bands) or dropping the biggest party hits at Hollywood&rsquo;s LAX and NYC&rsquo;s Marquee, Steve Aoki has become a jack-of-all-trades. Between his daily treks touring the country (and lately as far a field as London and Japan) he manages to run one of the most respected indie labels in the country, Dim Mak (founded bands such as The Kills, Pretty Girls Make Graves, The Von Bondies and others and also currently home to Bloc Party, The Rakes, Moving Units, Scanners, Pony Up, Whitey etc.) as well as promote his own nights in LA &amp; NYC featuring any band looking to make it (yes they all played for him first: The Bravery, Bloc Party, M.I.A., Lady Sovereign, She Wants Revenge, Wolfmother, Kaiser Chiefs, Editors, Spankrock and the list goes on). <br /> <br /> &ldquo;I like hip-hop and respect hip-hop just as much as I do rock.  As for everything else, a good song is a good song.&rdquo;</p><p><a href="http://www.steveaoki.com/">www.steveaoki.com</a>&nbsp;</p><div id="liveset" class="uitleg"><p>Fan van Steve Aoki?
