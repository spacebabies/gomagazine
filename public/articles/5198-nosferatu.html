Maybe his Hardcore-style was already born? :)</p>


	<p>About 12 years ago, he began spinning music with a tape-recorder and some sort of turntable. Cutted, pasted, and recorded several mix-tapes during that time. After a couple of years he managed to build his own studio. He bought some equipment, like a small sampler, and he produced several tracks, not released on vinyl, but just for friends&#8230;</p>


	<p>Then, when he spinned as a DJ in a coffeeshop, he managed to produce a demo-tape wich he gave to a friend, who had some connections in the record-business. Then he had the opportunity to release his first record : &#8216;All that she wants&#8217; on BÃ¼nkor Beats-records.</p>


	<p>At that time he was booked at several small parties, and some of them were very underground. For some people in his country, they know wich underground-party we mean: The massive &#8216;squat&#8217;-party, downtown The Hague! With lots of other DJ&#8217;s like Virus, the english DJ Raw (not the mc), and many more&#8230; DJ Mystic (Nosferatu&#8217;s first DJ-name) spinned for over 7 hours non-stop that night!</p>


	<p>After several years of working (more as a DJ, than a producer) he bought some new equipment and made a new demo. One day DJ Ruffneck was performing at a party, and Nosferatu gave his demo to him. Then his career really started; he got an appointment with P.v.Kerckhoven (Ruffneck) and Andrea v.d. Rhee from Cardiac Music bv. and he became part of a great recordcompany! &#8216;Inspiration vibes&#8217;, &#8216;Dangerous Battle&#8217;, and many more were made by the hand of Nosferatu.</p>


	<p>Now, together with Endymion he owns the Enzyme label. The tracks on Enzyme can be heared on many parties throughout the world, played by many respected DJ&#8217;s.</p>


	<p>Nosferatu will continue to produce Hardcore and he can be seen on many parties as a DJ, representing the vicious Enzyme-virus&#8230;</p><p>Fan van Nosferatu?
