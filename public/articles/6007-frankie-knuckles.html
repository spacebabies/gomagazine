Speelt Saturday 02 August op Loveland Festival.</p><p> He has evolved from precocious teenager with a knack for being in the right place at the right time to a senior statesman in the music industry actively promoting Dance music while serving with distinction in the National Association of Recording Arts and Sciences. Frankie Knuckles has achieved a number of &#8216;firsts&#8217; in Dance music. Among the most recent are the first recipient of the Grammy Award for Remixer of the Year 1997 and he is believed to be the first DJ ever to have a street named after him &#8211; Honorary Frankie Knuckles Way in Chicago.</p>


	<p>Frankie Knuckles was born in the Bronx, New York City, in 1955. His first exposure to the Dance music world came as a young teenager with his friend Larry Levan. Both began attending David Mancuso&#8217;sLoft parties. The duo soon were well-known among both DJs and the guests who attended parties and developing Dance clubs across Manhattan. Both Levan and Knuckles were intensely interested in the craft of the DJ. Frankie got his first opportunity to spin records in a club with a 6-month stint offered by Tee Scott at Better Days in 1972. The pair also helped DJ Nicky Siano at The Gallery blowing up balloons and setting out food. In the summer of 1972 Larry Levan convinced Frankie to hang out with him at the Continental Baths, a bathhouse that also had a small dancefloor. Frankie ended up staying, working for the Baths until their closing in 1976. He built up a strong following for his growing skills as a DJ.</p>


	<p>In the mid-70&#8217;s entrepreneur Robert Williams, a good friend of David Mancuso, moved to Chicago. He quickly set about trying to create a Chicago version of The Loft. He eventually purchased property on West Adams Street and opened US Studio. The venue was referred to as the Warehouse by those attended due to the building&#8217;s industrial feel. Soon US Studio was thrown into a tailspin by a competitor, the Bowery. Seeing the need for a better option, Williams bought property at 206 South Jefferson St. in Chicago and set about creating the Warehouse to open in early 1977 . Williams also needed a great DJ. He first attempted to entice Larry Levan to leave Manhattan for Chicago. He then turned to Frankie Knuckles, who was putting together what work he could in the aftermath of the closing of Continental Baths. Frankie was concerned about the possibility of moving to Chicago only to have the club fail. Williams and Knuckles reached an agreement in which Frankie would be a sort of silent partner in the business to help insure against early closure. The Warehouse formally opened in March of 1977 with Frankie Knuckles as resident DJ.</p>


	<p>Frankie&#8217;s residency at the Warehouse introduced Chicago audiences to both the skilled mixing Frankie Knuckles had learned from luminaries such as Nicky Siano and his friend Larry Levan and the sounds of New York Disco. Frankie&#8217;s sets at the Warehouse followed the early 80&#8217;s beginnings of Electro by groups such as Peech Boys and D Train. Frankie Knuckles also engaged in a wide range of experimental mixing using reel to reel tape to create entirely new versions of Dance tracks. This encouraged others to do similar, usually more rudimentary, projects at home.</p>


	<p>In 1982 the Warehouse elected to double its entrance fee and, frustrated with the new policy, Frankie Knuckles left. He opened the Power Plant in an old electrical substation and continued to preside over exciting sets that began introducing the home-made sounds of original Chicago House. Around the same time, Ron Hardy, a DJ who predated Frankie as part of the Chicago Dance music scene, returned after an absence of over 5 years. The owners of the Warehouse renamed it Music Box, hired Ron Hardy as resident DJ, and a competitive rivalry began that pushed Dance music and, in particular, the sound of Chicago House relentlessly forward. Chicago developed one of the most vibrant Dance scenes in the world and artists such as Jesse Saunders, Jamie Principle and Marshall Jefferson began releasing records during 1983 and 1984 that imitated the musical styles popular at the Power Plant and Music Box.</p>


	<p>At about the same time as House was moving forward to worldwide success, the House scene back home in Chicago was faltering. Hip Hop began to rise as a hot new sound and battles between organized crime and the City of Chicago took a toll on the nightlife scene. The Power Plant closed in 1986 and Frankie Knuckles briefly went to another club called <span class="caps">COD</span>&#8217;s then opened Power House in 1987, but it was closed down with pressure from the city. Music Box closed its doors in 1988. Frankie Knuckles returned to New York City in 1987.</p>


	<p>Shortly after returning to New York Frankie Knuckles signed on with Def Mix Productions, a management firm for world-class DJs formed by Judy Weinstein and David Morales. Frankie has remained part of Def Mix to the present day. In the 1990&#8217;s Frankie Knuckles continued to thrill audiences with his sets in a 6-year residency at New York&#8217;s Sound Factory and in club nights around the world. He also became a recording artist and top-flight remixer. His work includes the albums Beyond the Mix and Welcome To the Real World as well as mixes for Michael Jackson, Diana Ross, Chaka Khan and many more top recording artists. In 1997 Frankie Knuckles was honored by receiving the first Remixer of the Year award from the Grammy Awards. He is well respected within the music industry as a whole having served as a governor and trustee for the New York City chapter of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. Frankie Knuckles continues to tour bringing the sound of House and contemporary Dance music to club audiences around the world. His recording of Bac In Da Day with Jamie Principle from the album New Reality topped Dance charts in the summer of 2004. Perhaps one of the most fitting tributes is the official naming by the City of Chicago of the street that goes by the original location of the Warehouse Honorary Frankie Knuckles Way on August 25, 2004.</p><div id="liveset" class="uitleg"><p>Fan van Frankie Knuckles?

<p>  Rock e grande schermo sono un'accoppiata vincente. Un connubio in apparenza insolito ma che spesso è servito a raccontare l’atmosfera di un determinato periodo storico o a sottolineare un’azione, come nei lavori di registi come Martin Scorsese, Julien Temple, Wim Wenders e Jean-Luc Godard.  Lo Spazio Oberdan a Milano con la rassegna "Rock Music and Film", in programma fino al 3 agosto, offre un'ampia carrellata di questa particolare unione.

<p>    I’m not Nate--I’m nowhere near as organized. This was going to be the year I stayed on top of stuff. Naturally, it’s also the year I spent a month traveling by train across the U.S. Obviously there’s a ton of stuff missing here--I could have bolstered the list to 100 if I’d relistened more before composing it, and a gift from Nate in May by itself features a number of things I could have used. And god knows how many albums I haven’t gotten to yet or, in the case of many I like a great deal, </p>
