Speelt zaterdag 22 december op Planet Rose.</p>As cited last summer in the UK dance floor bible; Mixmag, his universally embraced single on Bedrock Records Stoppage Time became the stand out anthem of the year at the likes of Cocoon at Amnesia, and Dc10 in Ibiza along with Secretsundaze in London. The single has surpassed the 5-digit mark in sales and continues to shift by the truckload and to appear on numerous compilations from artists as diverse as BPitch Controls Kiki, Francoise K, Wally Lopes and Sven Vath. <br /><br />Last summers success looks like being just the tip of the iceberg compared to the current buzz on Guy. First up is This Is Balagan. As the first part of a three single deal with Cocoon, the single has already been described by Sven Vath as the tune of the 2006 Ibiza summer season and who are we to argue? Follow up singles Sea of Sand and After Love alongside a remix for Dominic Eulberg are sure to make Guy one of the hottest producers in the techno scene. The coming months will also see new singles on John Digweeds Bedrock and Satoshi Tomeiis SAW imprints respectively, not to mention Guys own Supplemental Facts label promising further singles, many of which have a good shot at nomination for tune of 2006 come the end of the year. By now you might have guessed hes a production machine! <br /><br />As a touring artist, Guy has embraced the Ableton software to create a unique DJ experience rocking festivals across the world from MUTEK in Detroit, Sonar in Barcelona, and Gods Kitchen in the UK. Upcoming shows across Europe alongside the likes of Richie Hawtin, Tiefschwarz and Mathew Jonson will put him in the premier league of touring artists before the year is over. <br /><br />All this success may have been a surprise to Guy if youd told him when he was 15 how his life might turn out. As a member of his native Israels Under 16s national football team, he started to play guitar and very quickly his love of football was replaced by an obsession with music. Listening to bands like Joy Division, My Bloody Valentine, Sonic Youth, Soft Cell, and The Beach Boys, Guy established a unique understanding for music that has informed his musical development, and from which flows his unique sound of bittersweet harmonies, natural mixture of strong and deep grooves, and futuristic bass lines. <br /><br />Awards in his homeland have come thick and fast with him collecting Israeli Music Associations award for The Best Israeli Electronic Artist&quot; in 2003, while Israel&#39;s MTV and leading dance music magazine awarded him &quot;Best Electronic Producer&quot; in 2003 and the award for &quot;Best Export Artist in 2005. Guy has also received acclaim in his homeland for his composing for contemporary dance arts in Israel, working alongside the world-renowned choreographers Ohad Naharin and Sharon Eyal. <br /><br />While Guy may have quickly risen to prominence since his first single in 2002, with product on labels as varied as King Street, Kinky Vinyl, Alternative Route, and Bedrock, and becoming a darling of the compilation market for the likes of Ministry of Sound, Renaissance, Global Underground and Cocoon, he is excited about what the future holds for his upcoming projects and touring opportunities. With the last 12 months being so successful, who can blame him? <div id="liveset" class="uitleg"><p>Fan van Guy Gerber?
