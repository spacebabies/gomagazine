The harmonious balance of chaos and order is the secret of this night
Or to be honest we thought why not turn the whole thing on its head?
Why not just drop a concept that will not only make heads turn but also
Explain the workings of a bass loving creative mind</p></p><p>Amsterdamaged -The small but infamous crew has run parties around the town of
Amsterdam for a few years running now from squats to cozy clubs and the
smallest of bars this crew begs no mercy and gives no quarter in a town where
everyone gave up on drum?n?bass this crew strived monthly to provide music
for lovers of dnb and still do. Famed for their no frills approach to dnb you
get the energy with not a jot of the dress up.
Having gained national acclaim through its award winning mc the crew is moving
on leaps and bounds giving Amsterdam a little taste of pure energy in motion
