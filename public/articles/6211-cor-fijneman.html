Speelt Saturday 06 December op Indoor Winter Festival Part 1 ( The Hardstyle/ Trance Edition).</p><p> Searching for a style that was melodic, Cor found this in trance music and that is the style he still plays today. In these years he got in contact with Arny Bink and Tijs Verwest. Tijs Verwest (also known as Tiësto) asked Cor to play some melodies for his new tunes and this collaboration resulted in trance classics such as Theme from Norefjell, Earth and Sparkles which were released worldwide.At that time Cor was also asked to become resident at club Spock in his hometown Breda. In club Spock he played every Saturday night for 4 years and developed his style he still plays today: raw uplifting trance.</p>


	<p>In the summer of 2000 Black Hole Recordings offered Cor Fijneman the opportunity to mix the 5th part of the In Trance We Trust series. This cd was sold all around the globe and resulted in some great gigs in Holland and in countries like Norway, Panama, Columbia and Greece. The number of gigs went even bigger after the release of In Trance We Trust 6 and Maxim Editions V1.0. Around this time Cor not only produced tracks with Tiësto but released some major tunes with Threesome (Mohave/Gobi), Dj Montana (Groove Lounge Method) and Impact (Behind The Mirror).</p>


	<p>Winter 2002 saw the release of his new album, Outstanding, a superb party mix of the hottest trance and harddance tunes around, complemented with a tour where Cor created mayhem across dance floors around the country. Spring 2003 Cor Fijneman released his new single, Venus (Meant To Be Your Lover), a collaboration with acclaimed singer and trance diva Jan Johnston. With this hitsingle Cor Fijneman has entered charts around the globe and received support from dj&#8217;s like Paul Oakenfold, Judge Jules and above all Tiësto. Most of all, this single was the theme of the illustrious Tiësto In Concert event, May 10th 2003. This resulted in many requests for remixes for acts like Jurgen Vries, Lasgo, Andain and Three Drives. These remixes proved to have the right sound and were supported by many dj&#8217;s like Judge Jules, Ferry Corsten, Marco V, Johan Gielen, Paul Oakenfold and Paul Van Dyk. At the end of 2003 Cor Fijneman entered the Dj Mag Top 100 list at a respectable 94th place.
This list has been a definite goal for dj&#8217;s all around and has set standards because of the huge influence by the audience who visit the clubs and festivals in dance music and make this top 100 by sending in their 5 most appreciated dj&#8217;s. April 2004 will see the release of Cor&#8217;s new single Healing, featuring Anita Kelsey, a well respected soul and jazz vocalist known from the hitsingle Shed My Skin by D*Note. Anita Kelsey is one of the major voices in UK jazz and soul and she also performed with acts like Spice Girls, Jean Carne and Bill Wyman.</p>


	<p>Cor has played in clubs all over the world these last years, just a few examples are Cream Amnesia Ibiza, Club Glow Washington DC, Godskitchen Birmingham, The Gallery London, Matrixx Nijmegen, Club Space Miami and Illusion Lier. Besides these venues Cor played not only at all the major festivals in Holland like Trance Energy, DanceValley, Impulz, Lovefields and Innercity but also at festivals outside Holland like <span class="caps">WEMF</span> Canada, Lloret Outdoor Spain, Illusion 16 Years Belgium, Cream Digital Love United Kingdom, <span class="caps">WMC</span> Miami, Loveparade Germany.</p>http://www.djcorfijneman.com/
