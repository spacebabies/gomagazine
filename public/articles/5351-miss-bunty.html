Nicknamed &#8220;Shirley Bassey on Acid&#8221;, Miss Bunty is a powerful entertainer who knows how to spice up any party.</p>


	<p>Bunty started her career at an early age as a lead vocalist to many punk-rock, rock, funk and soulbands. One of her first performances as an freestylevocalist/MC were at the legendary Amsterdam club RoXY, singing along the deep dark drum and bass tracks of dj Carlton. Later she teamed up with many known dj&#8217;s in very different styles, a short list: house-dj&#8217;s like Roog, Joe T Vanelli, Erick E, Tom de Neef, The Soulproviders, Junior Sanchez and Laidback Luke, uk garage dj&#8217;s such as Femme Fatale, Ramsey and Fen, Vanbellen and, Johnson, Drum and Bass heroes like Fabio and Aphrodite.</p>


	<p>Her flexibility to add her great voice and spirit to many kinds of music, enabled her to work alongside garage and drum and bass mc&#8217;s without any bloodshed, and was the source for an unexpected memorable duet with uk-top vocalist Omar at the beachbop summer 2001.</p>


	<p>Miss Bunty is highly in demand for studio work, lending her songwriting skills and voice to tracks by artists such as Project 2000, Bonobo, Aphrodite, Ronald Klinkenberg and Sander Kleinenberg. New collaboration with producers like Laidback Luke, The Soulproviders and Tom de Neef are scheduled for this summer.</p>


	<p>The raw and unpolished soulstirring vocals and impressive stagepresence gave Miss Bunty a series of nominations and awards, to name a few: &#8220;Grote Prijs van Nederland&#8221; best Vocalist(1999), nomination Best Vocalist Lucky Strike Dance Awards (2001), Golden Gnome Best Vocalist / MC (2002). Miss Bunty is a busy lady, singing on stage a few times a week, she knows the tricks of the trade;  Miami&#8217;s Winter Music Conference 2003 saw her hosting and performing first for 7 hours at the Opium Gardens, to be driven by stretch limo to Space to perform for another 2 hours alongside Sander Kleinenberg. As Dance Icon Joost van Bellen once said, Miss Bunty is one of the best in the bussiness, always leaving a crowd begging for more.</p>http://www.missbunty.com/
