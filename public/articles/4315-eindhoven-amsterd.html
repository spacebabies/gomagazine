Their new club is a perfect place to launch a new evening in the new year.</p>


	<p>For the line-up we have chosen a wide range of the Electronation sound, from our resident Terry Toner with his fresh electronic house sound. Laidback Luke   has been one of our favourite DJs from the beginning and after last year&#8217;s three year&#8217;s anniversary party performance, we had to bring him back, and to make things even more exciting we have decided to invite the original House pioneers 808 State to DJ their way into that ecstatic mixture of electronic mayhem.</p>


	<p>808 State was formed back in 1988 in Eastern Bloc, a DJ record shop in Manchester England run by Martin Price. Customers Graham Massey of Biting Tongues fame and Gerald Simpson got talking with Martin and soon realised how much they had in common. After recording a Hip-Hop flavoured EP as the &#8216;Hit Squad Manchester&#8217; together with MC Tunes, they decided to call themselves 808 State. They got the name from the Roland drum machine <span class="caps">TR 808</span> and the state-of-mind that they shared.</p>


	<p>Their first album &#8216;Newbuild&#8217; on Price&#8217;s Creed Records, a raw Acid House album, was released during the Summer of &#8216;88 and has since become a very collectible item. During the making of the second album &#8216;Quadrastate&#8217;, Gerald Simpson departed to continue with his solo project &#8216;A Guy Called Gerald&#8217;. DJ&#8217;s Andrew Barker and Darren Partington, a.k.a. the Spinmasters, got recruited on a permanent basis to fill up the gap left by Gerald.</p>


	<p>The third album entitled &#8216;90&#8217;, now signed under the <span class="caps">ZTT</span> label, included the hit &#8216;Pacific&#8217; which had been an underground classic until then. This album was also released in the US under the name Utd. State 90 on Tommy Boy records. During this time 808 State also produced an album for MC Tunes and released several hit singles. Their biggest selling album &#8216;Ex:el&#8217; followed, however Martin Price decided to depart from 808 State.</p>


	<p>The 1992 album &#8216;Gorgeous&#8217; included a remake of the <span class="caps">UB 40</span> classic &#8216;One In Ten&#8217;. After extensive touring, 808 State took a break and it wasn&#8217;t until 1994 that the single &#8216;Bombadin&#8217; was released. During that year a fanclub-only CD entitled &#8216;State to State&#8217; was pressed containing unreleased material.</p>


	<p>It took two years to finish the 1996 album called &#8216;Don Solaris&#8217;. To celebrate its release in June 1996, a free concert was given at the Castlefield Amphitheatre in Manchester. Don Solaris featured artists such as James Dean Bradfield of &#8216;Manic Street Preachers&#8217;, Louise Rhodes of &#8216;Lamb&#8217;, Michael Doughty of &#8216;Soul Coughing&#8217; and showed 808 State from a darker side.</p>


	<p>To celebrate ten years of 808 State, 1998 saw the release of a Best Of 808 State album, entitled 808:88:98. In 1999, the classic Newbuild album was re-released on Rephlex records. Currently 808state are looking for a new recording contract.</p>


	<p>And of course to make the evening even more special we have invited our local VJ heroes Kijkbuiskinderen to add extra atmosphere and visuals the way they have done for us many times in the past at places like Dance Valley, VJ-ology and much more.</p>


	<p>Unfortunately for Terry Toner and Laidback Luke and very fortunately for us, they will have to rush because on the same night they have to DJ in our second half of our Twin City party in the Paradiso Amsterdam</p>

	<p>After the great success of last year&#8217;s  Electronation anniversary party we didn&#8217;t want to change too much from our concept so we have decided to invite our resident DJs and friends to join us and play in the entire three floors of the Paradiso, but we couldn&#8217;t pass on the opportunity to book our favourite Breakbeat masters the Plump DJ&#8217;s to join us once more,</p>


	<p>Breakbeat was slumbering away peacefully before the Plump DJs gave it a loud wakeup call with their first release &#8216;Electric Disco/Plumpy Chunks&#8217; in 1999. With thundering momentum, their critically acclaimed productions reformatted dance floors and perceptions, and set new production standards. Some were scared silly, few fell back asleep, but many jumped up for a shower of Plump freshness. And an alarming universal consensus was formed. Everyone wanted a piece of the Plump pie, and fat was in.</p>


	<p>Inspired by a top shelf girlie mag entitled Plumpers, Lee Rous and Andy Gardner met and the Plump DJs were born. It would be nice to say that before making music, the Plump DJs had glamorous jobs &#8211; but we can&#8217;t. Before the duo met Andy worked in a cardboard box factory and Lee was a waiter at a Berni Inn. The music started as a hobby and after a number of excursions and collaborations with the Freskanova camp, the two found their oats at the Finger Lickin&#8217; stable.</p>


	<p>A global need for the bold attitude, squidgy sounds, and Behemoth bass lines amplified by the Plumps pushed the duo into their Soho based Laboratoire Plump to manifest a large destiny. Jerk to inflate! Inflate it did, next vinyl.</p>


	<p>&#8216;The Push/Remember My Name&#8217; on Finger Lickin&#8217;, waxed the hairs off everyone&#8217;s legs and the screams of delight led the lads into completing their feature album &#8220;A Plump Night Out&#8221; in 1999. The album sampler rocketed to No.1 on DJ magazine Breaks and Beats chart for three issues in a row.</p>


	<p>Before Lee and Andy could smile for another photo shoot, remix opportunities were piled on the doorstep. Jumpin&#8217; and Pumpin&#8217; (with perhaps a bit of pimpin1) through the year of chronic concoctions the Plump DJs&#8217; spin of Stakker Humanoid&#8217;s classic &#8216;Humanoid&#8217; and a spate of other remixes for The Freestylers, DeeJay Punk Roc and Mint Royale ballooned their status. Perfecting a repertoire of coercive gruff sounds, the Plumps were in high demand.</p>


	<p>Their remixes for the likes of BT and Orbital became the bubbles of oxygen that rose to the top of the ocean of global dance music. The Plump ship made waves, putting the excitable &#8220;Oh&#8221; back into <span class="caps">H20</span>. Historians, dance music critiques, and Soho restaurateurs chuckled with glee as Lee and Andy won the Galaxy loaded with dancefloor ammunition; launching Smartbombs and dropping laughing gas onto Funny Break terrain, replacing testosterone nu-skool with accessible sonic boom and arse wiggle.</p>


	<p>Also this time we will use the entire Paradiso. The basement will host our God&#8230; She&#8217;s a DJ! concept with Eva Maria, Martine and Sandrien.  The upstairs room will have Electronation residents nonstop Pablo Lamberti, Nauta, Dax &#38; Clockwork, Herr Arter, Dion and the Groove Addicts. and the in the main room  Laidback Luke, Don Diablo, Terry Toner, Mason ,GenErik and of course Plump DJ&#8217;s.</p>


	<p>The visuals on the night will be in the creative hands of our resident VJ&#8217;s 310k</p>


	<p>Date: Saturday 21 of January Location:     Paradiso, Amsterdam Line-up: The Plump DJ&#8217;s, Laidback Luke, Don Diablo, Terry Toner, Mason, GenErik, Pablo Lamberti &#38; Nauta, Dax &#38; Clockwork, Herr Arter, Dion, Groove Addicts, Eva Maria, Martine, Sandrien</p>
