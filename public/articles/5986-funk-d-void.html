Speelt Friday 27 June op  Drift Summertime Editie .</p><p> The Placebo Syndrome&rsquo;. An album with a wild concept, it tells the <span class="caps">LSD</span>-inspired story of the conflict between the not-much-fun Sir D&rsquo;Voidoffunk and his laugh-a-minute nemesis Starchild (aka Clinton, who eventually triumphs in getting the old misery guts to feel that funk and shake his booty).</p>   	<p>It&rsquo;s no coincidence that Lars Sandberg has flipped Sir Nose&rsquo;s handle around for his Funk D&rsquo;Void alias, because he&rsquo;s most definitely got the funk. Much in demand as a DJ around the world, he&rsquo;s a critically acclaimed producer as well, with two albums to date &rsquo; &lsquo;1997&rsquo;s &lsquo;Technoir&rsquo; and 2001&rsquo;s &lsquo;Dos&rsquo;(both on Soma) &rsquo; not to mention a string of killer singles and remixes.</p>   	<p>Now Lars has his third long-player, &lsquo;Volume Freak&rsquo;, ready to go; and it&rsquo;s a beauty that sees Lars up his game, not to mention the decibel level. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m known to listen and produce music at abnormally loud levels, so I thought the title was fitting,&rsquo; says the 32-year old.</p>   	<p>Picking up where it predecessors left off, &lsquo;Volume Freak&rsquo; is grounded in techno: the majestic opener &lsquo;Emotional Content&rsquo; distills 15 years of Detroit&rsquo;s machine music legacy into eight minutes; the sublime mood music of &lsquo;All That Matters&rsquo;, &lsquo;Sueno For Somebody&rsquo; and &lsquo;Electrix 313&rsquo; lap at your ears like rose-scented surf; and the massive Heavenly Mix of &lsquo;Diabla&rsquo;, with its gut-butting bass and swirling, euphoric keys, provides a healthy dose of contemporary club oomph.</p>   	<p>The decision to include &lsquo;Diabla&rsquo; a brave move: in its Heavenly form (different from that included on 2001&rsquo;s &lsquo;Dos&rsquo;) it was one of the biggest tunes of tunes on 2001; and none less than The Chemical Brothers used to close their DJ sets with it.  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve spent the last 18 months trying to figure out how to follow a record that successful,&rsquo; says Lars, who nonetheless appreciates its role in propelling him to the top of the dance music pile. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s always fantastic to get great feedback about your music, especially so with &lsquo;Diabla&rsquo;, because I really put a lot of work into that track. It also helped my DJ career when it became successful and opened my sound to a wider audience.&rsquo; (Lars&rsquo; new found profile has also had its amusing side: with heavy irony, the origins of his nom de plume came back to haunt him this year at a festival in Belgium, where he was announced as &lsquo;Funk Avoid&rsquo;.)</p>   	<p>But &lsquo;Volume Freak&rsquo; sees Lars move his sound on with vocal tracks like &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t Get Enough Of A Bad Thing&rsquo; and &lsquo;Way Up High&rsquo; (a move that&rsquo;s sure to make a Lars a festival favourite next year &rsquo; he&rsquo;s working on a kick-ass live show). &lsquo;It&rsquo;s still a very electronically-based album with the usual melodies and strings, but there&rsquo;s more depth and the vocals,&rsquo; he says. The result is like a good time, sun-kissed Underworld, and a world away from the soulless techno scene in which Lars cut his teeth.  &lsquo;Techno ended up becoming extremely lazy and soulless for me,&rsquo; says Lars. &lsquo;It became very rhythm-based, too cold and abrasive for my liking. I&rsquo;ve always been into the more emotional, melodic side of techno anyway, and I think it&rsquo;s coming to the fore again. The deep and musical sound has more longevity and substance than loop-based percussive tracks. The whole experience was extremely enlightening, having words put to your music. Everybody loves a song, and I felt as if I needed to take the next step with my sound.&rsquo;</p>   	<p>The emphasis on melody and vocals has got to be something to do with the fact that Glaswegian-born Lars now lives in Barcelona. &lsquo;It was a case of &lsquo;don&rsquo;t think about it, just do it&rsquo;, and I haven&rsquo;t regretted it,&rsquo; he says of the move.  &lsquo;What are the plus points?&rsquo; he continues. &lsquo;The climate; the beach; palm tree; bars; clubs; architecture; girls in the summer; tapas; San Miguel on draft; Sonar; siestas; the laid back attitude; cheaper, bigger apartments; and a hundred parks.&rsquo; Indeed, it seems the only thing he misses about his home town is the great clubs and cheese &amp; onion pasties.</p>   	<p>Another plus point of Barcelona almost turned out to be a certain type of gentleman&rsquo;s nightspot. The hot climate inflamed Lars&rsquo; blood &rsquo; he almost ended up opening a lap dancing club.  &lsquo;I investigated it,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;but the Spanish mafia wanted an enormous pay-off, and the whole situation was becoming really seedy. I was going to call it &lsquo;Flaps In Your Lap&rsquo;.&rsquo;</p>   	<p>Spanish lap dancing&rsquo;s loss is your gain. &lsquo;Volume Freak&rsquo; is a panacea for the winter blues; a ray of Mediterranean sunshine brightening up both your stereo and the dancefloor; an antidote to insubstantial excesses of electroclash (&lsquo;It&rsquo;s just not my thing: zero funk factor,&rsquo; says Lars); one in the eye for the dance-music&rsquo;s-dead brigade; synth music concerned with the future as well as the past; a record that sounds dead good if you crank it up to ten; eleven tracks that make you happy.</p>http://www.somarecords.com/
