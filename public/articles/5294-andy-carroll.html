And his co-DJ at Sandbaggers was a guy called Dave Williams. Then, in the autumn of 1982, when Dave Williams retired from Djing, he was joined on the decks by Mike Knowler who, at that time, was still a student at Liverpool University. In addition to playing at Sandbaggers, Andy and Mike did gigs for the Liverpool Polytechnic Students Union, and Preston Polytechnic Students Union.</p>


	<p>In the autumn of 1984 Andy Carroll became one of the resident DJ&#8217;s at Liverpool&#8217;s State Ballroom. Andy took over from Steve Proctor on Thursdays, because of Steve&#8217;s move to London. Andy also became Mike Knowler&#8217;s co-DJ on Fridays &#38; Saturdays, the nights formerly hosted by Frank Cookson, who had left the State to get married and start a family. The music policy at the State was quite similar to Sandbaggers, &#8216;alternative dance&#8217;, but with the addition of some Soul and Hip-Hop on Saturday nights; and some Rockabilly on Friday nights. (However, by 1986 a smattering of House Music was also on the menu at the State, following Mike Knowler&#8217;s visit to New York City&#8217;s New Music Seminar in the July of that year.)</p>


	<p>In the summer of 1988 it was Andy Carroll&#8217;s turn to attend the New Music Seminar, and Andy was immediately turned on to the New York House Scene. Then, at the end of that summer, Andy Carroll and Mike Knowler teamed up with James Barton to present Liverpool&#8217;s first regular Acid House night &#8216;Daisy&#8217; on Mondays at the State Ballroom. By the autumn of 1988 the State was playing house music exclusively: Thursday, Friday and Saturday. However, the State closed in November 1989, following pressure from the police who considered that the club was overcrowded and out of control! And, of course, the rising use of drugs was also a major issue as far as the Police were concerned.</p>


	<p>Andy Carroll started Djing at Quadrant Park in February 1990, following an invitation from his old friend Mike Knowler. Mike had become resident DJ at the Quad a month earlier, in January, but didn&#8217;t feel he could do the job single handedly. So Andy became the resident DJ on Monday nights, and co-DJ&#8217;d with Mike Knowler on Saturday nights. (Mike Knowler remained the resident DJ on Thursdays and Fridays). However, by the time of the August Bank Holiday, in 1990 , Andy had introduced John Kelly and James Barton to the Quad. And, under their banner of <span class="caps">HAX</span> Promotions, Andy and James promoted a number specialist nights at the Quad. Examples include: <span class="caps">LFO</span> / Trevor Fung; Derrick May; N.Joi; K.Klass; and Katherine E. Then when the Quad All-Nighter kicked off at the end of November 1990 Andy Carroll was part of the elite team DJ &#8217;s set up to do the job: viz Mike Knowler, Andy Carroll , John Kelly and James Barton. Unfortunately, the Quad All-Nighter ran for only 40 weeks, closing in July 1991 due to licensing irregularities. When Andy Carroll mysteriously left the Quad in the spring of 1991 his regular Saturday night slot was taken over by John Kelly.</p>


	<p>Concurrent with their DJ residency in the Quad, and under their banner of <span class="caps">HAX</span> Promotions, Andy Carroll and James Barton promoted a series of very successful concerts at Liverpool&#8217;s Royal Court Theatre. The first of these was Adamski: and later concerts included K.Klass, The Prodigy, New Atlantic, Katherine E, Quadraphonia &#38; T-99, N-Joi plus Marina Van Rooy and Connie Lush. The success of these concerts didn&#8217;t go down well with Quad owner Jim Spencer, who saw them as unwelcome competition to his Friday nights!</p>


	<p>The autumn of 1991 saw the opening of two new venues in Liverpool City Centre: the Academy , in Wolstenholme Square (later to become Cream at Nation); and the 051 (in the former Beer Keller) located at the bottom of Mount Pleasant. The 051 resident DJ&#8217;s were Andy Carroll &#38; James Barton. And the House scene had effectively moved back into Liverpool City Centre. As a consequence, the audience numbers at the Quad began to decline. And by Christmas Eve 1990 it was clear that the Quad was finished.</p>


	<p>The 051 got off to a Brisk start, with Aleister Whitehead presenting the opening night alongside resident DJ&#8217;s Andy Carroll and James Barton. The music policy was US House &#38; Garage, and the crowd were visibly more fashionable than the crowd at the Quad. However, in many ways, the 051 was a flawed venue, which some people likened to a concrete canyon. As a result, the sound tended to be blurred and echoey and the concrete floor and walls created, for some people, a somewhat bleak ambience. Within a year, the size of the crowd at the 051 was visibly diminishing, and Andy and James felt that it was time to move on.</p>


	<p>For Andy and James, moving on meant setting up their own night, where they were totally in charge including running the door. The venue they chose was the back room at the Academy because it was the right size for an exclusive night: and it had a separate entrance, from the main club, allowing Andy and James to control the door. This new night was Cream and it was an immediate success!! (The only small hiccup was another club in the midlands who felt that they owned the name Cream! But in the end it didn&#8217;t turn out to be a problem). The success of Cream has been well documented elsewhere. But it must be emphasised that it was Andy Carroll who started Cream with James Barton, assisted by Darren Hughes. Later on, of course, Andy resigned from Cream in order to concentrate on his DJ career, thus allowing Darren Hughes to take over.</p>


	<p>Andy Carroll&#8217;s international DJ profile includes having played at some of the best clubs in the world, in New York, Bueno Aires, Toronto, Berlin, Vienna, Munich and Paris. He has also undertaken an Australian tour as a part of the Cream entourage, and DJ&#8217;ed as support act to Jamiroquai when that band toured in the UK and Japan. For the past eight or nine years Andy has been working in Ibiza at both Amnesia &#38; Manumission.</p><div id="liveset" class="uitleg"><p>Fan van Andy Carroll?
