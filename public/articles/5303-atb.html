André Tanneberger, however, manages to give each of his tracks its own spirit while still surprising fans and always remaining <span class="caps">ATB</span>. That is exactly what it takes to make an internationally successful producer.</p>


	<p>From time to time in each music genre, artists turn up who manage to stir up the scene and thrill the audiences. On the international dance scene, <span class="caps">ATB</span> is without a doubt an example of this type of producer and artist.</p>


	<p>After over eleven years and five <span class="caps">ATB</span> albums, the last four of which all made it into the German Top 10, André has become a leading musician and producer. Not just on the dance scene. International stars like Heather Nova, Moby, William Orbit and Michael Cretu from Enigma have called on his services. He also performed with Bryan Adams at Rock in Rio, supplied remixes for pop legends like A-ha and has travelled all over the world to play as a DJ.</p>


	<p>But what makes <span class="caps">ATB</span> so different? What has shaped his style? André has a unique skill in combining ambient and trance with a wide variety of musical influences. He delivers dance songs with melancholic hooks and wonderful harmonious, smooth and relaxed sounds that carry you away. André has repeatedly laid milestones in modern club music. While many struggle throughout their careers, André immediately went into overdrive with his first <span class="caps">ATB</span> track &#8220;9 P.M. (Till I Come)&#8221;, which reached the top of the UK charts in 1999 and brought his music to all continents of the globe. His new single &#8220;Marrakech&#8221;, taken from the upcoming album &#8220;No Silence&#8221;, sees André change his sound again completely, but still characteristically remain <span class="caps">ATB</span>. The song is a great club track that sends out a summer feeling to get us all ready for that sunny beach holiday. It even impressed Hollywood as &#8220;Marrakech&#8221; was chosen to be the title track for the action thriller &#8220;Mindhunters&#8221;, coming to German cinemas on 24 June. (The film stars Christian Slater, Val Kilmer and LL Cool J). André has worked with various artists again on his fifth album &#8220;No Silence&#8221;. The first single &#8220;Marrakech&#8221; was recorded with British vocalist Tiff Lacey, who previously worked with trance legend Paul Oakenfold. Canadas Roberta Carter Harrison, who sang on &#8220;Let U Go&#8221;, &#8220;I Don&#8217;t Wanna Stop&#8221; and &#8220;Hold You&#8221;, is also back on board. &#8220;Todays hectic life and high level of stress is having an extreme effect on people. Music can provide us with calm, distraction and relaxation,&#8221; claims André Tanneberger. If you take the time to listen to &#8220;No Silence&#8221;, you will understand the real purpose behind <span class="caps">ATB</span>&#8217;s way of making and living music. The melancholic and spherical beats combined with charismatic female vocals create an environment where your mind can drift away.</p>


	<p>You can also see how important ATBs message is due to the fact that he not only produces the music himself and takes his songs to the masses as a DJ, André Tanneberger also wants to share his knowledge and skills. He has therefore set up the <span class="caps">SEAP</span> in Bochum with his producer partner and friend Rudee. The &#8220;School for Engineering and Audio Producing&#8221; is a production school where young ambitious producers can find their way to a professional career in the music business. The <span class="caps">SEAP</span> also provides a platform for those wanting to perfect their hobby and move beyond their previous musical and production horizons.</p>


	<p>&#8220;No Silence&#8221; is a concept album. An album that you can listen to in one go without taking a break, on which the individual tracks are connected via intros and outros to form a complex, intense musical experience. Listeners are immediately carried along and caught under ATBs spell. Music is Andrés ecstasy and you can sense that throughout the album. <span class="caps">ATB</span> told us about his obsession on his last album &#8220;Addicted To Music&#8221; and thankfully he has not decided to look for a cure yet. &#8220;No Silence&#8221; holds a message that will continue to be heard thanks to the modern age of CDs in the days of cassettes, this album would have been chewed up due to overplay.</p>


	<p>With 5 studio albums, a &#8220;Best Of&#8221;, two mix albums, a <span class="caps">DVD</span> and countless chart singles under his belt, André Tanneberger&#8217;s musical expertise is unchallenged. His name is synonymous with quality and success, not only as a producer and songwriter, but also as a top flight DJ. Over the past eight years, <span class="caps">ATB</span> has developed into a truly worldwide phenomenon. Following a fantastic tour of the <span class="caps">USA</span> in December, this year begins with trips to Dubai and China. February sees him out on the autobahn again for his &#8220;The <span class="caps">DJ 3</span>- In The Mix -Tour. Volumes 1 and 2 of the series both hit the top ten of the charts and the time is ripe for a third strike.</p>


	<p>&#8220;The <span class="caps">DJ 3</span>- In The Mix consists of two perfectly mixed CDs featuring brand new tracks, previously unreleased <span class="caps">ATB</span> mixes, some of André&#8217;s all time favourites and a new, exclusive <span class="caps">ATB</span> song.</p>http://www.atb-music.com/
