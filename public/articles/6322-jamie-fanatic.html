<p>Tommy Hall in his Tenderloin apartment in San Francisco. Photo by Jamie Soja.The story of the Thirteenth Floor Elevators – Austin’s favorite psychedelic sons – is rich, rowdy and textured.  They sparked a counterculture, birthed a sound and inspired a generation of musicians. In fact, their work and their legend continue to serve as inspiration to new artists and to a legion of cult followers.By Thorne Dreyer / The Rag Blog / February 21, 2009See 'A Long, Strange Trip: An originator of acid rock</p>

<p>England’s match in Sevilla on Wednesday night looked like what it was, the eighth best team in the world playing the best team in the world away from home without several key first team players.  England are a good team and one result doesn’t change that; Spain are the most gifted and complete international side the world has seen for several years and would have beaten just about any side the world could have offered up.

<p> Mike Ford has not had many pats on the back over the past couple of years, but England's defence coach deserves one now for the system he put in place to stop Wales. Teams in the past have specifically targeted individual players - South Africa gang-tackling Jonah Lomu in the World Cup final of 1995 springs to mind - but this was a carefully plotted piece of man-marking with Joe Worsley frequently moving from the back row to stand in midfield opposite Jamie Roberts. It worked well enough for Wo</p>

<p>Well, I did it. After seeing  MSKS's list of her top 20 favorite songs of all time  and feeling the pressure from her to create my own, I've finally done it. Not only was I told that creating this list was a MUST, but I was also told that they had to be in number order. Have you ever thought about it?
