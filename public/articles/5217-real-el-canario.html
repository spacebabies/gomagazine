On the Canary Island of Tenerife, he contributed to the enormous revival of Hip Hop, where he had to start from scratch. But his development asked for a new challenge.</p>


	<p>Nowadays Ezequiel V. Real is guaranteed to fill clubs. His unique style of mixing has made him a favourite of a diverse audience. Effortlessly, the musical genres flow from one into the other: from Disco to Merengue, from Hip Hop to Salsa, from R&#38;B to Reggae, and back again. Whenever Real finishes, he leaves his audience behind steaming and sweating.</p>


	<p>The origin of his style of mixing is hidden in Real&#8217;s past as a breakdancer. He started breaking when he was eleven year&#8217;s old, &#8216;Whenever I was on the dancefloor, I expected a DJ to surprise me with breaks and beats: my style of mixing comes from that. Whatever I wanted to hear, I now play for my audience&#8217;.</p>


	<p>The amount of records the audience hears during a Real performance is overwhelmingly large. The dancefloor only exceptionally gets the chance to hear a record in full. Inimitable, a hundred records in an hour is not uncommon. &#8216;When I come by train, I pack three to four hundred records, when by car even more. I play a record a minute, sometimes even more than that&#8217;. Preparing a set in advance is unthinkable to Real. &#8216;I have been doing this for thirteen years, I know all my records from back to front. I prepare nothing and I copy no one. Creativity is the credo&#8217;.</p>


	<p>It has become unimaginable to not have DJ Real around in todays dutch club scene. once he started up his early residencies, Monday nights jam sessions at the ministry, Real&#8217;s Joint at Nighttown, Bassline ( paradiso ), Chocolate ( off corso ), Soulpunkers On Disco Speed ( Now &#38; Wow ) soon followed many others. Highlights were the performances with New York Dj/Producer Tony Touch, Kenny Dope ( Masters At Work ), and being the support act for the only performance of busta rhymes and Jay Z in the Netherlands.
His newest art piece, an full lenght debut album, is forthcoming.</p>http://www.djrealelcanario.com/
