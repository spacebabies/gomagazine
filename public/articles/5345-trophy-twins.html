	<p>Industry endorsement</p>


	<p>&#8220;If asked to name the biggest rising DJ stars of the past twelve months, there would be no competition&#8230; the accolade easily goes to the Trophy Twins. Their brand of party funk house and un-matchable energy behind the decks has had promoters talking and clubbers following them in droves&#8221;. &#8211; Judge Jules</p>


	<p>&#8220;The Laurel and Hardy of House music! With real presence behind the decks, they are more than a legendary double act! They are 2 great entertainers with a huge future ahead of them&#8221;. &#8211; Ben @ Good Greef</p>


	<p>&#8220;The Trophy Twins are perfect for Garlands because their sets can go from fluffy &#8216;n&#8217; funky to dirty and nasty in a seamless way that few DJs can pull off. On top of that they are up for having a laugh behind the decks, which is what crowds want to see these days. We hardly ever book DJs for our funky room, but on the occasions that we do, the Trophys are first we think of&#8230;&#8221; &#8211; Huey @ Garlands</p><div id="liveset" class="uitleg"><p>Fan van Trophy Twins?
