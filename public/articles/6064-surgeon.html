Speelt Saturday 23 August op Mysteryland.</p><p> Compared favorably with Detroit original Jeff Mills from his earliest Downwards singles on forward, Child&#8217;s tracks have been a mainstay in the popular Motor City DJ&#8217;s sets. Although Surgeon releases have worked an increasing affectation for acid and trance, an economy of sound and basic hardness combine his and Mills&#8217; sound. A noted and increasingly popular DJ himself, Child grokked his skills from hip-hop and electro jocks (&#8220;Tour de France&#8221; is a mainstay of his DJ sets), filling out his style with a driving toughness and appreciation for rapid cutting and flipping. Surgeon&#8217;s entry into production was also noteworthy; urged on by producer Mick Harris (Child is a fan of Harris&#8217; Scorn project), the former Napalm Death drummer locked Child in his tiny studio, imploring him to &#8220;go mad.&#8221; The result, the self-titled debut EP, was released on Downwards, and was instantly hailed as some of the highest quality U.K. techno of its time. Releases for Soma, Blueprint, Ideal Trax, and the ultra-exclusive Tresor label followed, with the debut LP, Basic Tonal Vocabulary, appearing on Tresor in 1997. Balance followed in 1998, as did Force &#38; Form in 1999.</p>


	<p>More recent additions to his repertoire include releases on his Counterbalance imprint as well as collaborations with Regis as British Murder Boys, resulting in tracks which take a tone far darker, denser, and more industrial than those from his Tresor years.</p>


	<p>Equally influenced by early electro-pop innovators like Tomita and <span class="caps">YMO</span>, experimental groups like Can, Faust, and Suicide, and the tough grit of American electro and techno (Robert Hood, Hashim), Surgeon&#8217;s mash-up is both straightforward and subtly experimental. Further influences from Coil, Psychic TV, and Whitehouse in recent works and DJ appearences do not go unnoticed.</p>http://www.dj-surgeon.com/

<p>  Reigning “American Idol” winner Jordin Sparks could be the hardest working woman in show stage business.  More Photos   From singing at the Super Bowl to cutting her new album, the 18-year-old has been going nonstop and is now suffering from a hemorrhaged vocal chord.    When vocal chords are healthy they both move freely and comfortably as one sings or speaks. In Sparks’ case half her vocal chords are damaged, so when she sings, only half do the job.    “When a young performer has a bleeding </p>

<p>Saturday night I parked my car on Broad Street. It drew a large crowd and a thundering ovation. That's my Volvo, center stage! I had to hold my camera way above my head to take this, so pardon the blurosity.      Oh. No one cares about my car. They came to see bands...would y'all please sit down? I can't see the stage. Thanks.  Hey! That's Fallentown's own Now Sleepyhead playing...I like that band and I enjoyed doing sound for them this weekend. They had their CD release party Saturday, drawing </p>

<p>Friends, I am getting very bored of saying, “I told you so.” First ABBA, now this.   Today, four newspapers reported that many people were stung by jellyfish during the New York City Triathlon. Specifically, Lion’s Mane jellyfish, which can be up to eight feet in the body, and have been known to have tentacles 120 feet long.  Hold on. Let me look at my list of “last things I want to hear” and see where that is . . .   6. The Cloverfield monster is here to see you. And he’s brought flowers! Oh wa</p>
