Speelt Friday 22 August op Strictly 45's.</p><p> 2002 was definetly the breakthrough year of dj shapeshifter.</p>


	<p>After a year of residency @ the 070DNB parties, he got more and more bookings across Holland.</p>


	<p>Shapeshifter&#8217;s record choice cannot be described easily as he tends to adept himself to the crowd he&#8217;s playin for, but it has to be said that he has a preference for the harder stuff.
His mixing style ranges from tight to creative and if possible on 3 decks.
With his mixing skills he managed to become upcoming dj #1 at the first national dnb-awards 2002 in Holland.
Expect to see much more happening in the future since shape has succesfully finished the <span class="caps">SAE</span> audio-engineering course and is now beginning with producing.</p><div id="liveset" class="uitleg"><p>Fan van Shapeshifter?

<p>File this under "Shays, Both Ways": Politico picked up on the story in the Hartford Courant  yesterday, in which Chris Shays morphed into shapeshifter mode:  "On the issues, I work with Republicans and Democrats.

"If he is going to do what he says and work with Republicans, I am going to be one of his natural allies that he'll turn to if he wins."  Shays and Obama are opposites on the war (Obama strongly opposed it; Shays lied us </p>

<p> By Travis Woods  Space rock, prog rock, psychedelia—whichever combination you choose, the formats those words describe all essentially refer to the same type of music: a nebulous genre that weaves dense tapestries of effects-pedaled guitar lines though even denser song structures until the entire self-indulgent sprawl interlaces into a massive, intractable Gordian Knot of decadent, M.C.

<p>There’s definitely a discrepancy between the way drum & bass is produced and represented between the northern and southern hemispheres. Acts from Australia have been pushing a live and interactive sound, expressing a more raw quality and added soul with the highest profile act to emerge for a while being three boys from Perth, Australia called Pendulum.
