<p>Bernard Spaander, the man behind Cosmic Force, began his musical career at the early age of 15. He first started making mixtapes with a cassette recorder and a turntable he borrowed from his mother. Then he started to experiment with guitar stompboxes and effectprocessors which he used on exsisting music. Attracted by the (at that time) upcoming hiphop/electro scene of the early eighties, he started his own hiphop crew <span class="caps">TLD</span> (The Lyrical Domain). After two years of MC-ing he thought it was time to move on to something else. Influenced and inspired by these fresh hiphop and electro sounds combined with the more experimental music from Pierre Henri, Oscar Sala and Kraftwerk, he developed his own sound. The first Cosmic Force release was in 1996 on Clone Records. After this, he had numerous releases under different pseudonyms, like Ototax, Proskool, Double Dutch and Dr. Switch &amp; Mr. Portamento.</p>
<p>Besides his work as a producer Ben is also a collector of analogue synths and an expert in operating them. With his knowledge of analogue systems he started his studio, known as Studio X.</p>

<p>As too brief a respite from the turmoil on Earth - from the politics, from Islam, from the diminishing scope of men's concerns and the consequent meanness of their goals - I will go to Mars, to Venus, to the planetary systems of other stars via the Internet, but chiefly to planets and bodies in the solar system where Man has sent querying spacecraft and robotic investigators, just to see some evidence of success in his long-range endeavors.  Of course, I do not think our government should be con</p>

<p>Tantra teaches us to value and develop our awareness, to cultivate energy, and to link that energy to consciousness in order to become more aware. Human existence is a dual state and we live in a dual universe: male and female, light and dark, day and night, positive and negative, pleasure and pain, life and death, and so on. It is the aim of yoga and tantra to unify our experience of duality so that we can also experience unity, the transcendent state beyond death.  Tantra describes the human b</p>
