Speelt Friday 14 December op Rauw.</p><p>When Wannabe a Star &amp; Miss B-have step behind the decks nobody expects what&#39;s going to happen in the next few hours. At first the audience is puzzled, shocked. Is it a serious DJ set? Or a stand up comedy routine? Is it strictly for the underground? Are they professional pole dancers? Or fashion-bitches from hell?</p><p>The answer for most of the clubbers comes when DJ Wannabe a Star starts getting deeper into her eclectic music style, while Miss B-have does her parody of a Vegas Showgirl. What they do is bring the best of everything to a club or party, with the sole intention to entertain the masses, both musically and visually. Along the way they hold up a mirror to someone&#39;s face, especially that of the clubber who takes his nightlife routine a little too serious.</p><p>It&#39;s this endearing self-mockery that makes them stand out in a world overpopulated with DJ&#39;s.</p><p>Wannabe a Star &amp; Miss B-have met in the nineties, while they were dancers of Pantera, a group club-dancers that was the most notorious in Holland. During the Miami Winter Music Conference of &#39;96, where DJ Wannabe a Star alias Jojanneke van der Veer was performing with Pantera, she bought her first records. The management of Pantera started to promote her as a DJ with great success ever since. Her mixing skills are flawless, done with the true essence of sensuality.</p><p>She plays a large variety of music, from hip hop to house, from disco to techno, from pop to punk rock and back again. PJ (P for Performance!) Miss B-have, alias Bianca Kroon, was a professionally trained dancer when she joined the Pantera Group. Because of her unique wit and acting talents, combined with total body control and a sensual presence, she is a perfect match for Jojanneke. DJ Wannabe a Star provides the sounds, PJ Miss B-have provides the energy. Their performances and DJ sets haven&#39;t gone unnoticed: they won the honourable &quot;Gouden Kabouter Awards&quot; for &quot;Most Sexy Dj&#39;s&quot; and in 2004&nbsp; for &quot;Best Act&quot; for their poledancing performances.</p><p>Nowadays they are the resident DJ&#39;s of globetrotting&rsquo;s filthiest party Club Filth. In 2005 they toured with theatre festival &quot; De Parade&quot; through Holland and in cooperation with party organisation Veel Meubel Stukken they have been throwing their own party &quot;Back to Brooklyn&quot; for several years now. As icing on the cake they formed DiE BeND. A new and crazy fluorescent band that involves huge homemade instruments and blows the roof of every club! Their first single &quot;Yo Sjiiit, My Sjiiit&quot; (produced by Benny Sings &amp; Rednose Distrikt) will be released on Rush Hour records soon.<br /><br />CURRENT RESIDENCIES:<br />Back 2 Brooklyn, Amsterdam, The Netherlands<br />Club Filth, Worldtour<br />Fuque les Balles, Amsterdam, The Netherlands<br />Costa Plenty, Bloemendaal aan zee, The Netherlands<br />EVENTS:<br />La Paloma, Barcalona, Spain<br />Mysteryland , The Netherlands<br />Lowlands 2005, The Netherlands<br />Manifesto, The Netherlands<br />De Parade 2005, The Netherlands<br />Supportact Kane, The Netherlands<br /><br /><a href="http://www.wannabeastar.net/">www.wannabeastar.net</a></p><div id="liveset" class="uitleg"><p>Fan van Miss B-Have?

<p>                   Something has happened to my little space at the top right corner of AOL, where I put all my favorite places that I want to get to quickly......I think it is called a carousel or such???All my places just disappeared...I had my journal link up there also...so when I tried to get to my journal by typing in the URL, I wasn't able to! I went to one of my friends journals and clicked on my link that she had in her other journal spot and got in that way! grrrrrrrrr...              </p>

<p>Wacko Wednesdays: Habitual Lateness  by PurpleCar   From Words Mean Things:   Do you tend to be late or on time? I am pathologically on time - even when I don’t try, I’m there five minutes before I’m supposed to be. My friends, on the other hand, are almost always late. This infuriates me.  From PE Online:  Perennial lateness inhibits success. It’s annoying. It slows progress. And yes, it is disrespectful. Someone once told me: “Being late is one of the most selfish things you can do.” Many peop</p>
