Speelt Saturday 05 April op IChiOne presents Subversive Renaissance 20.</p><p>It all started in 1990, with the Drum&rsquo;n&rsquo;Bass of M-Beat &amp; Remarc, Goldie, Prodigy, <span class="caps">SL2</span> and Roni Size. After having visited a couple of parties, Silvahfonk decided, in 1996, to buy secondhand turntables and he started experimenting at home. After some time he got his first booking by Urban Unit at Blaak, Rotterdam (Queensday). In this time he was known as &lsquo;Energy&rsquo; because of his energetic personality.</p>   	<p>Due to circumstances he moved to the north in 1997.</p>   	<p>Silvahfonk (means Silver Funk/Spark) was in that time also interested in Hiphop and he decided to leave the DJ&rsquo;ing be for the time beeing. After having joined in the, now still underground, Hiphop-group M.I.C. (Mo Ill Communication) for a while, Silvahfonk was discovered as an MC by members of the Zombi Squad. In 1998 he participated in the &lsquo;Grote prijs van Nederland&rsquo; in the category &lsquo;Hiphop/Freestyle&rsquo; and he became second in the intial rounds.</p>   	<p>In 1999, after the failed Hiphop-thing, Silvahfonk started spinning again after getting in touch with an other DJ from Groningen. After an unexpected successful performance in Vera, Groningen, he decided to set up a DJ-Team called &lsquo;Chainreaction&rsquo;. Members of this team were Chris Combo and Silvahfonk and together they spinned a combination of Breakz, Darkstep &amp; 2-Step and Drum&rsquo;n&rsquo;Bass &amp; Jungle in clubs as Hemkade and The Palace (Groningen).</p>   	<p>Not much later DJ Josje aka Yorobi contacted him and since then he&rsquo;s like &lsquo;the eternal guest&rsquo; at Josje&rsquo;s internetradioshow, Intermezzo Music, at www.nauticradio.net  He&rsquo;s been asked to come and perform regularly and he&rsquo;s very thankful for that.</p>   	<p>After a great performance at the first edition of Subsonik, 6 years ago now, (Subsonik is a monthly Drum&rsquo;n&rsquo;Bass party in Simplon, Groningen) he got himself a spot there as resident DJ. Besides that, he was recruited by the Complex Beatz crew, from the well known recordlabel. This resulted in getting to a lot of different spots all across the country.</p>   	<p>Silvahfonk anno 2004 is now busy as co-producer of still unknown but very talented producers, to be able to spin their own productions at parties. Also he did small party at De Kult Cafe in Groningen alongside techno minded dj Sounder. Called <span class="caps">DNB</span>@Kult. That night was to promote new unkown talents for a small crowed.</p>   	<p>Since 2005 Silvahfonk got also involved by a new organisation that called &ldquo;Underground Music&rdquo; in Apeldoorn (NL)    Underground-Music supports the present dance music scene and will provide future activities. This is non-commercial related and is mainly to promote dance music and DJ&rsquo;s and live acts. For more information check www.underground-resistance.nl</p>   	<p>Silvahfonk has a lot of passion for the sound that is Drum&rsquo;n&rsquo;Bass but maybe his heart can be found mostly with the jungle-sound. He loves the &lsquo;94 records of producers like Remarc and Congo Natty but also the productions of the present in whick this sound can be found more and more.</p>   	<p>In 2005 Silvahfonk won the dutch drum n bass awards as <span class="caps">BEST</span> Upcomming dj and as <span class="caps">BEST DJ</span> of the year For more detail info visit. www.dnba.nl  Since end 2005 Silvahfonk presents a new radio show strictly for Jungletrain.net one of the biggest drum n bass internet radio stations in the world. Called <span class="caps">ROYAL</span> &amp; <span class="caps">RAW</span> with his partner in crime www.fre4knc.com he presents the new and old but most of all pure sounds in drum n bass and jungle. Every tuesday from 22:30 till 00:30 you can hear the most soldiers and newcommer in Holland.</p>   	<p>His style is dark, uplifting, summer-like, jungle-ori&euml;ntated and funky and he tries to bring this to the public in his own energetic and creative way. He also tries to be exclusive by picking &lsquo;that other tune&rsquo;. DJ&rsquo;ing to him is not a job but more the pure representing of the thing he&rsquo;s completely into. He wants people to get to know a genre with no equal. Or, to cite himself, &ldquo;Drum&rsquo;n&rsquo;Bass is my life-style, I am a true junglist!&rdquo;.</p>http://www.silvahfonk.com/
