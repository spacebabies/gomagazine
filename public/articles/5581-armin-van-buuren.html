Speelt Saturday 01 December op Fabulous.</p><p>With trance undergoing its much-hyped third renaissance &#8217; if you believe it had ever died &#8217; the boy Buuren, widely credited with creating the blueprint track for the genre, Blue Fear, at the tender age of 19, is at the forefront of the revolution to reclaim quality dance music.</p>


	<p>Born in Leiden, Holland (on December 25, 1976) to a musical family &#8217; his dad had a serious penchant for a diverse range of genres including punk and electronica &#8220;to get rid of the stress of everyday life&#8221;, whilst his brother is a prodigious guitar player &#8217; Armin indulged his passion for music from a young age, blowing all the money from his paper round on records. His mum won a computer when he was 10, &#8220;So as a little kid I was writing my own Basic programmes, and learnt about the technology from there.&#8221; He progressed from making the usual tapes for his friends, put together on a cheap set of decks that he wore out learning to mix, after discovering his uncle experimenting with different sequences on his computer. &#8220;I was so amazed at what he was doing, since that moment I&#8217;ve been addicted to creating music!&#8221;</p>


	<p>In the early 90s, Holland&#8217;s upfront dance scene meant that although Armin was too young to go clubbing, he knew the music inside out from listening to the radio. &#8220;I loved dance music immediately &#8217; this great rebellious sound that was so different to the &#8216;beautiful&#8217; songs of the 80s&#8221;. Citing electro pioneer (famed for his awesome visuals as well as his groundbreaking synth sounds) Jean Michel Jarre as a major influence, as well as Dutch producer Ben Liebrand, who later mentored him in his mixing and producing, Armin was soon cracking out consistently stand-out tunes that graced compilations across the globe, and his dj bookings were looking pretty healthy to boot. But despite his music career taking off at such an early age, Armin thought it was wise to have something extra in case the djing didn&#8217;t work out, and studied for a law degree. He actually got a job offer with a law firm but says it&#8217;s not really his thing, though he does acknowledge he&#8217;d look good in a suit</div></div><footer><div class="row"><div class="small-12 medium-6 columns"><div class="article-connection"><h5><small>Vorige in Coverstories</small></h5><h3><a class="head" href="5580-wanna-be-a-star.html">Wanna Be A Star</a></h3><p></p><div class="article-meta"><a href="../authors/7-max-beta.html">Max Beta</a><h6 class="subheader">Coverstories // 29 november 2007 05:10</h6></div></div><a class="tiny button secondary right" href="5580-wanna-be-a-star.html">Lees meer</a></div><div class="small-12 medium-6 columns"><div class="article-connection"><h5><small>Volgende in Coverstories</small></h5><h3><a class="head" href="5582-goldie.html">Goldie</a></h3><p></p><div class="article-meta"><a href="../authors/7-max-beta.html">Max Beta</a><h6 class="subheader">Coverstories // 01 december 2007 05:10</h6></div></div><a class="tiny button secondary right" href="5582-goldie.html">Lees meer</a></div></div></footer><!-- Piwik -->
