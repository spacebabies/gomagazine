	<p>Fascinated by the possibilities of electronic sound synthesis, he began collecting synthesizers by the age of 12.</p>


	<p>Inspired by the sets of Sven Väth at the legendary &#8216;Omen&#8217; club in Frankfurtbetween the years 1992-1995, Eric discovered his love for techno and electronic music.With the help of Andy Düx, Eric practiced in the overdrive studios in 1995.At the same time he started studying audio engineering at the <span class="caps">SAE</span> Frankfurt.</p>

These labels featured releases from Gayle San, The Advent, Chris Liebing, Hertz, Rush, etc, and were also a platform for Sneo&#8217;s own releases. Both labels stand for high quality innovative techno and are successful world-wide.</p>
