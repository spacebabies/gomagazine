Jaziah was born in 1977 and raised in Amsterdam. His interest in music starts early when he picks up drumming at the age of seven. For years his drum kit is his best friend. That is until he buys his first set of turntables at the age of 17. His natural talent for mixing and scratching develops quickly and soon he starts playing at small parties and local clubs in Amsterdam.</p>


	<p>Things change when he gets asked for a life-changing gig in Venezuela in 2001. It marked the change from a great hobby to a serious profession. Dj-ing and producing music becomes his destiny. From 2001 Jaziah plays all major clubs in Holland. Clubs like Paradiso, Now&#38;Wow, Paard van Troje and Jimmy Woo are his new playground. His diversity of styles makes him stand out and residencies at Jimmy Woo and at Thank god it&#8217;s Friday in club Sinners follow.</p>


	<p>In 2005 Jaziah starts playing for Holland&#8217;s no #1. house night <span class="caps">RUSH</span>, which is organized by Chemistry, one of the leading international dance organisations in The Netherlands. Here his dj career grows to another level and he becomes one of the well-known faces in the Dutch dance scene.</p>


	<p>At the same time his career as a professional producer takes off. After producing music for television and theatre shows he now is ready to unleash his own sound to the world. A sound in which you can hear the diversity of his sets in a truly musical way. His first records will come out in the second half of 2006. With both his producer and dj career steadily on track the future looks more than fine for this gifted partystarter. Jaziah is guaranteed to rock the house!</p><div id="liveset" class="uitleg"><p>Fan van Jaziah?
