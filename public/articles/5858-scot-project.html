Boasting a string of sensational production and remix projects, Scot Project is set to follow this success during 2003 with his stunning debut album.</p>   	<p>Having learned to mix at the age of 13, Scot Project got his first break in 1986 playing breakbeat in a youth club. When the acid house movement hit in 1988 Scot Project was hooked on the sound and possibilities that the world&rsquo;s biggest youth culture offered. By 1990 he was a resident of several clubs in and around Frankfurt and could be found spending his pay cheques on a small but potent studio.</p>   	<p>Scot Project&rsquo;s first track &lsquo;X&rsquo; was released on Overdose shortly after, followed closely by the hugely successful &lsquo;U [I Got A Feeling]&rsquo;, which was released on Overdose / Positiva and charted throughout Europe. Soon Scot Project relinquished his residencies to tour the <span class="caps">USA</span>, Canada, Brazil, Russia and Europe, developing a loyal fan base across the Globe.</p>   	<p>Scot Project describes his style as; &ldquo;a combination of hard percussive elements mixed with melodic trance melodies coming in at the break, the perfect combination of sugar and spice!&rdquo;.</p>   	<p>Having established himself as one of the big names in hard dance, DJ Scot Project was offered a plethora of remixes, including Pulse, Fog, Area and Intercord among others. Most recently, he enjoyed massive success in the UK during 2001, applying the midas touch to; &lsquo;Firewire&rsquo;.</p>   	<p>&ldquo;Scot Project twiddles the knobs on this hard house hymn to his favourite computer programmer and comes up with an anthem so mindless it truly is a thing of beauty&rdquo; &ndash; Mixmag April 2001. Firewire went onto become one of hard dance&rsquo;s most timeless and instantly recognisable tunes.</p>   	<p>A year on from his breakthrough, Scot Project is steering away from remix work to concentrate on producing new tracks for his debut album on Overdose. His latest single &lsquo;Arome&rsquo; sold 5000 copies on the first day of its release and such success will undoubtedly be repeated when his next and currently &lsquo;untitled&rsquo; track is released during 2002.</p>   	<p>Scot Project&rsquo;s abrasive, transcendent style has certainly won him plenty of fans in the UK, where there is no shortage of demand for his futuristic sets from clubs and clubbers alike. A series of stunning productions and infectious DJ skills will ensure his continued success at the forefront of hard dance music.</p>   	<p>Scot Project is one of those rare artists whose musical style is clearly recognizable throughout the dance music world. His signature sound has helped create the harder side of the Trance genre, with unique combination of hard percussive elements mixed with melodic trance rhythms, he has become one of the most successful DJs/Producers in the global dance music. Over the past few years Scot Project has created waves around club-land with appearances at Godskitchen, Gatecrasher, Slinky, Global Gathering, Homelands, Dance Valley, Avalon, Goodgrief, and many more major festivals and clubs worldwide. Learning to mix at the age of 13, Scot Project got his first break in 1986 playing break-beat in a youth club. When the acid house movement hit in 1988 Scot Project was hooked. By 1990 he was a resident of several clubs in and around Frankfurt and was spending his pay cheques on a small but potent studio. Scot Project&rsquo;s first track &laquo;X&raquo; was released on Overdose in 1994 shortly after, followed closely by the hugely successful {U I Got A Feeling}, on Overdose/Positiva which charted throughout Europe. Since then Scot Project has established himself as one of the biggest producers of the harder edge of Trance genre, with a plethora of remixes and hit productions under his name including mega hits, {F Future is now}, {O Overdrive} and remixes like {second trip / Hennes &amp; Cold}, {Cosmic gate / fire wire} {Yoji Biomehanika / Ding A Ling} and {Beam vs. Cyrus / thunder in paradise}, and other artists such as Talla 2xlc, Derb, Brooklyn Bounce and Yves De Ruyter, which stormed UK and International dance charts. He is also responsible for the project Arome with successful releases such as visions of paradise, somebody and the massive success Hands up. Scot always found time to twiddle plenty of knobs in the studio. His melodic dance floor ripper &laquo;L&raquo; (Want Your Love) booted Eric Prydz&rsquo;s number one tune &laquo;Call on me&raquo; off the top spot of Discomania&rsquo;s 2004 yearly sales chart. The tune also ousted Mylo&rsquo;s &laquo;Drop The Pressure&raquo; and Deep Dish&rsquo;s &laquo;Flashdance&raquo; from the top of the German-based chart, with both Judge Jules and Fergie nearly wearing out their copies on their Radio One shows. 2005 has been one of the best yet for Germany&rsquo;s undisputed tech trance master. After more than ten years of top-notch studio production and crowd-pleasing DJ sets, the dreadlocked wonder released his long-awaited artist album, &laquo;A1&raquo;. The frenzied response to the tasty mix of new era productions and much-loved classics sent Scot and his record bag spinning from Kuala Lumpur to Canada to satisfy the appetites of hard trance-hungry clubbers. &laquo;A1&raquo; shows the progress of his music style, further pushing forward the evolution of the harder edge of Trance. Good examples are also remixes for Yoji Biomehanikas {Monochroma} and Yakooza&acute;s {I Wanna Feel} and recent remixes like cocaine 2006(yakooza) , Bravheart 06, Niels van Gogh &ndash; Pulverturm 2006(kosmo records) and his unique for promotional use only series&hellip; Scot-lovers will soon be reveling in the harder edge of the Scot Project sound with the new <span class="caps">TOCS</span> series on his very own Druck Records. <span class="caps">TOCS 1</span> (druck11) was already a promising start for another successful project. Watch out for <span class="caps">TOCS 2</span>, 3, 4, 5 2006 is looking to be full of goodies for Scot Project fans.

<p>Line-Up Trance Energy 2006  Dit was de line-up van de 2006-editie van Trance Energy op zaterdag 11 februari 2006.  2006 was het laatste jaar dat de organisatie nog maar drie stages had, in 2007 & 2008 deed de Future Stage zijn intrede.  Hele mooie herinneringen heb ik zelf aan het optreden van Markus Schulz op de Armada Stage, Armin van Buuren op de main en de B2B sessie van Cor Fijneman en Mark Norman op de mainstage. Echt heerlijk!  Live setjes en filmpjes volgen snel!  Line-Up:  Mainstage</p>
