Speelt Saturday 26 April op Hard Nature.</p><p> It was here where he found out that vinyl sounded so much better then any cd he had ever heard, so he bought himself 2 turntables and a mixer and started mixing everything together.</p> 		<img class="clsRight" src="http://djnagoom.com/img/img_marc1.jpg" alt="" /><p>Through his contacts with many dj&#39;s, it was easy to start his career and after a few months his first residence position at a big club in Holland was a fact, and the clubs got bigger as time went by.</p> 		<p>After working as A&amp;R for a recordlabel, he started developing his own sound. By buying himself a studio and working 24/7 he was determined to become bigger then ever. He started of with his first project which he did together with his friends and this became the best selling hard style tune ever. Ard und Jorn (16). After releasing this bomb he played everywhere throughout the country. Nagoom was no longer anonymous proving his remixes for Brennan &amp; Heart, Tonteufel and Tatanka.</p>  		<h4>But.....</h4> 		<p>Due to the high standard he compels himself to, it took some time to make a new record. By releasing Ard und Marc (akoustica) he did it again. This tune is still played by all the big names and gives energy to all the souls on the floor. And now we are standing at the dawn of his 3rd release and it promises to be as big as before..</p>  		<h4>At the moment</h4> 		<p>He is collaborating with respected producers like Zany, Flip vander Putte (Airport), Motu and of course Ard. This shows how the man is always working. Also his daytime job as &quot;Plugger&quot;, it means record promoter to radio and television, makes him a well-known name in Dutch music business. He knows what kind of music, makes people go wild and if you ask him what kind of style he prefers, he will tell you: &quot;somewhere between deep grooves / trance and progressive hard style&quot;, it has to be good and contains a lot of energy. If you see him play you feel the energy he is giving you, he is an artist with a great entertainment level which allows you to move and feel happy about it.</p> 		<p>Now this 30 year old dj, has grown to be one of Dutch most well known Underdogs in the hardstylescene. He has played together with all the big names you can imagine, in all the big clubs of Holland, Belgium and Germany, where he was voted for best German hard style dj of 2004.</p> 		<p>Be on the lookout for this BIG teddy bear, he is gonna come your way.</p><div id="liveset" class="uitleg"><p>Fan van Nagoom?
