the launch a brand new album series entitled &#8216;Across Borders&#8217;.  The 
unmixed compilation will be available on two formats (CD, 2&#215;12&#8221; and, 
of course, digital downloads) and focus on the very best production 
talent from a single country or region.  The album boasts a unique 
claim as it is the first time artists and producers have had a 
consolidated format to showcase their work.  Consequently, the series 
will be a welcome addition to Audio Therapy&#8217;s already burgeoning 
catalogue.</p></p><p>First up in the series is Greece, a country rich in production talent with the likes of Nikola Gala&#8217;s Perasma project signing to Ministry of Sound and Dousk gaining releases on John Digweed&#8217;s Bedrock label. The Audio Therapy imprint already has a history of supporting Greek artists with releases from Stel &#38; Good Newz and remixes from Christian Cambas and Kosmas Epsilon. This, alongside other factors, made Greece the obvious choice for the first release of the series.</p>


	<p>Already writing exclusive tracks for the album project are Christian Cambas, Dousk, G Pal, Jose Zamora, Kosmas Epsilon alongside Nick &#38; John Dalagelis, Nikola Gala, Phatjack,Stel &#38; Good Newz, Tonedepth and Viton.</p>


	<p>Label head honcho Dave Seaman says: &#8216;The amount of music I am given whilst out performing constantly amazes me. Being a DJ and running a label makes me an obvious target for producers to pass on their material. Sometimes, after a weekend of gigs, I have almost an albums worth of quality releases. A lot of the guys involved have already had some big releases on the worlds key labels like Bedrock and Yoshitoshi, we just wanted to unite all of them together on one album to show just how much of a current hotbed Greece is for quality material and talented producers.  There are many other areas and countries that are really producing some outstanding music. We hope to turn our attention to these as the series progresses&#8217;.</p>


	<p>Tour dates will be taking place in Greece throughout July to promote and launch the series in Greece. The dates will be announced on www.therapymusic.co.uk  and www.djdaveseaman.com .</p>


	<p>Also on the horizon is the new off shoot label &#8216;Therapy Music&#8217; which will allow Dave and co to sign and develop new artists as well as one off singles. The first single on the label will be released in May and is titled &#8216;Little Soul&#8217; by Stel &#38; Good Newz. The track can be heard on the upcoming Renaissance presents Therapy Sessions Vol. 2 compilation out on March 28th.</p></div></div><footer><div class="row"><div class="small-12 medium-6 columns"><div class="article-connection"><h5><small>Vorige in Danceberichten</small></h5><h3><a class="head" href="3308-pop-events-1-year.html">POP Events 1 year at TGIF</a></h3><p>Bron: POP Events</p><div class="article-meta"><a href="../authors/1-joost-baaij.html">Joost Baaij</a><h6 class="subheader">Danceberichten // 17 maart 2005 18:03</h6></div></div><a class="tiny button secondary right" href="3308-pop-events-1-year.html">Lees meer</a></div><div class="small-12 medium-6 columns"><div class="article-connection"><h5><small>Volgende in Danceberichten</small></h5><h3><a class="head" href="3310-the-sessions.html">The Sessions @ Lexion Venue 09.04.05</a></h3><p>Bron: Lexion</p><div class="article-meta"><a href="../authors/1-joost-baaij.html">Joost Baaij</a><h6 class="subheader">Danceberichten // 17 maart 2005 18:34</h6></div></div><a class="tiny button secondary right" href="3310-the-sessions.html">Lees meer</a></div></div></footer><!-- Piwik -->
