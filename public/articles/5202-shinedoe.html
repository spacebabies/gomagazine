Her mission was to translate the music through her dance movement.</p>


	<p>After performing for 4 years as a dancer throughout Europe, she decided to stop and focus on other things such as buying records (electronic music) for personal use and producing mix tapes for friends. Her music then was a mixture of US garage, Detroit techno and house. As a result of the mix tapes, her first gig was arranged by friends at Club &#8216;Ja&#8217; in Amsterdam. Then, she seriously start mixing music at the age of 19; she got her debut booking in 1995 at the <span class="caps">VIP</span>-club in Amsterdam, where she rocked the place and became resident dj. Including, a residency position offered at Club Stalker in Haarlem.</p>


	<p>Ever since 1995, she played on all the big festivals, clubs and parties in the Netherlands from Dance Valley to Awakenings. Also promoters from abroad got interested in her dj-set, so she got booked in  various countries as Germany, Italy, Sweden, China, Bosnia, Israel, Slovenia, Croatia to name a few.</p>


	<p>However, around 1997 until 2000 she played drum &#8216;n bass under the pseudonym &#8216;Black Magic Queen&#8217;, which gave her lots of success playing with big names in the scene.  After a while she just wanted to focus only on tech-house and techno.</p>


	<p>Shinedoe spins a variety of funky groove techno-set with tech-house influences. She likes to keep her set interesting with different flows. The crowed adores her because she really knows how to rock the place.</p>


	<p>In 2001 till present,  she started her own night called &#8216;INMOTION&#8217; at Paradiso and Club Amuse, where she invites (inter)national dj&#8217;s to play. Her debut release on 100% pure records is played around the globe by the likes of Sven VÃ¤th, Laurent Garnier, Richie Hawtin, Steve Rachmad, Ricardo Villalobos to name a few. She also runs her own label &#8216;Intacto Records&#8217; collaboration with 100% Pure owner Dylan Hermelijn. This label will be launched in September 2004.</p>
