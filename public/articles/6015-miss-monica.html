Speelt Friday 18 July op Houseware.</p><p> Maar dat zij met Miss Bunty dit jaar samen langs diverse festivals gaan touren is nog niet bij iedereen bekend. Reken maar, ze zetten de boel met z&rsquo;n tweetjes op zijn kop!</p><p>DJ Miss Monica was born on the 12th of March 1971 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Growing up in the biggest harbour city of the world, she started to go out in the house-scene in 1989 and discovered something that would change her life: <span class="caps">HOUSE</span>-MUSIC !!!</p>   	<p>She started DJ-ing in 1992. Thanks to her musical talent, she learned very fast. In 1993 she was asked to become a resident DJ at  &lsquo;NIGHTTOWN&rsquo; (one of the finest dance clubs in the Netherlands at that time, cap. 2000.).  In 1994 &rsquo; 1998 she got her own club-night, every first Saturday of the month at <span class="caps">NIGHTTOWN</span>, which was a huge success and she made the party people go crazy !!! She was asked to perform at different clubs and parties all over the Netherlands and her DJ-career was getting bigger and bigger. In 1996 she decided to stop working as a medical analist at a hospital  laboratory, to become a professional DJ.</p>   	<p>In 1996 she became one of the most popular DJ&rsquo;s in the Netherlands ( 3 &ndash; 5 performances a week ), thanks to her excellent DJ performances (with very fine mixing skills !!) and her mixed compilation CD&rsquo;s (check www.djmissmonica.nl for more info). She performed at the most respected clubs in the Netherlands like : Nighttown, Roxy. It, Waakzaamheid, <span class="caps">ASTA</span>, Mazzo, Maastheater, Escape, Paard, etc and the popular parties like M.T.C., Lunapark, Beachpop, <span class="caps">MAW</span> parties, Chesterfield party, Veronica&rsquo;s Mega Music Dance Experience (20.000 people), Dance Valley (25.000 people) and Extrema (parties and festivals). At the Fast Forward Dance Parade 1998 (300.000 people),  her  truck drew all the attention. She also performed for radio shows such as, Radio 538 &lsquo;van Diepen&rsquo;s Dance Department&rsquo; , Radio Veronica and local radio shows.</p>   	<p>As a result of her success in the Netherlands  she got international recognition and has performed at clubs and parties all over the world like: France (Including performances at Club <span class="caps">REX</span> and Club <span class="caps">QUEEN</span> in Paris), Ibiza (Pacha), Belgium (Caf&eacute; D&rsquo;anvers), Switserland (MAD), Turkey (Club 2019), Isra&euml;l (Haoman17), Spain, Mallorca, Cura&ccedil;ao (Mambo Beach), Germany and so on.</p>   	<p>Thank to her excellent performances and skills, she has spinned the wheels with national and international DJ&rsquo;s such as : Ronald Molendijk, Mark van Dale, DJ Jean, Michel de Hey, DJ Remy, Erick E, 100% Isis, Miss Djax, Laurant Garnier, Mr. C, DJ Djulz, Paul van Dijk, Jack de Marseille, Sander Kleinenberg, Eddy de Clercq (EDC), etc, etc.</p>   	<p>In 1997 &rsquo; 1998 she got a second resident club-night at <span class="caps">NIGHTTOWN</span>, on Wednesdag called: &lsquo;FRESH UP&rsquo;. Funky grooves and solid sounds to enjoy the party people. The party people responded enthusiasticly to &lsquo;FRESH UP&rsquo;.</p>   	<p>In July 1998 the unexpected happened. She became very ill with Mononucleosis, and even worse, she was diagnosed <span class="caps">CFS</span> (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome). Because of this very serious  illness she was not able to perform as a DJ for 5 years. In July 2003 she miraculously  recovered  from <span class="caps">CFS</span> and can live life again. Now she is getting into normal life, becoming stronger and stronger.</p>http://www.djmissmonica.nl/
