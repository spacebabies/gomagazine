Speelt Wednesday 31 December op New Years Eve With ....</p><p><span class="smalldark"> Als eigenaar van het platenlabel &lsquo;Stealth Records&rsquo; bewijst hij keer op keer een neus voor verborgen talent te hebben. Sanchez is &eacute;&eacute;n van de vaandeldragers van de internationale dancescene en natuurlijk op Mystery Land ter plaatse om het beste van Release Yourself te presenteren. <br /><br /></span><a href="http://www.releaseyourself.com/" target="_blank">www.releaseyourself.com</a></p><p>English:&nbsp;</p>   	<p>Treasured as a world-shaking, chart-topping transatlantic titan of house music, Roger Sanchez is thought to be one of the most recognisable DJ/producers in the international dance music industry. However, should you genuinely wish to identify the Grammy award-winning artist in the summer of 2006 then you will need to immerse yourself in the exquisite Balearic magic of his hot new album. Written and recorded, for the most part, at Roger&rsquo;s own private studio on the inspiring Spanish island of Ibiza, Come With Me is an autobiographical journey into the inner sanctum of a long-standing clubland legend.</p>   	<p>Five years since his critically acclaimed debut album, First Contact, was unleashed, and two and a half years in the making, Come With Me paints an authentic soul-soaked picture of the man behind the music. Comprised of 11 enchanting lyrical compositions that help further cement his stellar status &rsquo; not only as a DJ and producer, but also as a songsmith and vocalist &rsquo; the upfront album is built solidly upon sensational production and classic songwriting skills. &lsquo;Come With Me is a very emotional album,&rsquo; reflects Roger. &lsquo;It tells the story of my life over the past couple of years, and within that overriding theme every song tells its own tale. It&rsquo;s what I am about and it&rsquo;s a part of who I am. It starts off in the clubs and travels back, to my home and to my heart. A real journey, you know, through relationships, around the world&hellip;&rsquo;</p>   	<p>Come With Me is, therefore, as musically immense as the S-Man himself. His work spans three decades and is founded above all on a religious dedication to all kinds of music and a grounded belief that &lsquo;the best is always yet to come&rsquo; &rsquo; creating a positive mind-set that has allowed him deliver his most full-bodied studio work to date. Come With Me will overwhelm audiences with its heartfelt depth and scope as it cohesively blends a heavenly range of beats and rhythms &rsquo; including intense Spanish and Latin influences &rsquo; into a totally original new experience. From its opening club anthem, Turn On The Music, featuring the funk/soul vocals of <span class="caps">GTO</span>, which sets the tone as an infectious debut single, the album abounds with electrifying collaborations and vocals. These include the sultry songstresses Jacquita Perkins, Katherine Ellis, Lisa Pure and Suzanne Couch, the multifarious NY musician Freak, and British soul sensation Omar. Yet perhaps even more mind-blowing for those who have charted his progress is the fact that Roger lays down vocals himself on five tracks alongside the likes of revered Spanish musician Alejandro Sanz. Alejandro has previously teamed up with Shakira but rarely commits to collaborations, however, hooking up with Roger on I&rsquo;m Yours, Alejandro fell so deeply in love with the emotion-drenched song that he even added extra guitar instrumentation to the mix. This was a huge honour for Roger, who was in turn inspired to learn more about flamenco music by Alejandro&rsquo;s great grasp of rhythm. &lsquo;It took a lot of time to make the album sound a certain way,&rsquo; says Roger. &lsquo;For me, it&rsquo;s a matter of evolution. I try to constantly evolve in what I do, looking for different influences to incorporate into my own sound, different studio techniques to help raise my game.&rsquo;</p>   	<p>A perfectionist in the studio, Roger programmed the entire album himself &rsquo; from the all-important drums to some fantastic live strings that were performed by two cellists and a viola player, but by mixdown sound as rich as a full-blown orchestra. Created in Ibiza, a spiritual home for both Roger and his beloved house music, the magnetic influence of the island is unmistakable. He has enjoyed his cosmopolitan Release Yourself club residency here for the past five years, DJing weekly at the magnificent Pacha in Ibiza Town as well as at pre-club bar Cafe Mambo on the &lsquo;sunset strip&rsquo;. The multilingual maestro would not, however, ask you to &lsquo;Come With Me&rsquo; without ensuring his album is equally blissful for both lovers of uplifting dance and steamy downtempo music. Soledad (solitude), for example, is a meditative gem featuring his ex-girlfriend Monica Mira, who wrote and performed the vocals. &lsquo;We wanted to create an Ibiza chill-out kind of vibe,&rsquo; says Roger. &lsquo;I like ending the album with that kind of sound &rsquo; it&rsquo;s very much an important part of the whole experience.  It&rsquo;s the type of music that I like to hear when I am on a beach in Ibiza.&rsquo; Alternatively creating a brilliant balance of styles and moods and joining the storm of straight-up house singles to cater for those heart-pounding club moments are catchy instant classics like Lost, Free and the sizzling Hot 4 U.</p>   	<p>From the strobe-lit, smoke-filled dancefloors of the world&rsquo;s most momentous underground clubs through to his far-reaching radio shows and TV appearances that have touched millions, Roger is constantly evolving and relentlessly pushing the boundaries of dance music culture. Born and raised in Queens, New York, to parents of Dominican heritage, Roger absorbed all kinds of influential sounds as he grew up, from salsa, rock, funk and blues to disco, soul and hip-hop, and this passion for a broad spectrum of styles still rings true in his work today. A gifted breakdancer, graffiti artist and musician, he has played a variety of instruments such as the drums and guitar, but by the time he hit his teens he had been bitten by the DJ bug. Later, whilst he was at college as a student of architecture at the world famous Pratt Institute in New York, his father urged him to follow his heart, whether it meant designing buildings or basslines. So he did!</p>   	<p>Roger was soon spinning around the Big Apple at pleasure hot spots such as The Tunnel, Octagon Club and his very own Ego Trip clubland creation. On an unfaltering journey to the very top of his profession, he emerged from the 80s with a head-turning hit debut. Using the moniker Underground Solution, the first of many production pseudonyms for Roger, he delivered his seminal Luv Dancin&rsquo; via the illustrious Strictly Rhythm label in 1990. After founding One Records and later Narcotic Records, a second major club anthem, Another Star, followed, and his success continued to snowball throughout the booming 90s. During these years, he remixed such luminaries as Chic, Daft Punk, Diana Ross, and The Police, and contributed to the soundtrack of Hollywood movie Blade. Notably, in the course of a single week, he landed a trio of songs in the top 25 Billboard Charts, and a year on established his third label, R*Senal Records. Furthermore, working under the alias Transatlantic Soul, he created yet another club hit, titled Release Yo Self. It came to attention via Deconstruction Records in 1996/97 and was remixed by the likes of the Basement Jaxx and Todd Terry. Roger&rsquo;s personal concept of liberty through music, Release Yourself, was truly born. An incredible club night that has generated its own momentum over the years, Release Yourself grew and grew. It transformed into a radio show that reaches around the globe and into a highly sought-after club compilation series with its fifth volume due to arrive in the summer of 2006 on Roger&rsquo;s own Stealth Records label (established in 2002).</p>   	<p>Dramatic success of this nature can often dilute the creativity of some artists, but it was certainly not to be so with the serene S-Man. While his reputation as a &lsquo;superstar DJ&rsquo; and remixer with the Midas touch was growing to dizzying heights his feet remained firmly on the floor &rsquo; and he continued to innovate. &lsquo;The so-called &lsquo;superstar DJ&rsquo; culture was not something that I intended to be a part of &rsquo; nor was it how I started out,&rsquo; explains Roger. &lsquo;Really, as always, I just do what I do and am grateful to be able to follow my heart.&rsquo;</p>   	<p>A karate loving, incense-burning DJ with a difference, Roger has long remained ahead of the game by being true to himself. Unshakable in 2006 as he prepares to launch his album complete with a world tour by his band, he has also been writing songs for other artists such as Alanis Morissette and Pink. For those who misguidedly think DJs and dance music producers lack spirit, musicality or meaning, and most importantly for those who simply love good music &rsquo; Roger is back!</p>   	<p>Come With Me is released on 30th May (US) and in September (RoW) on Stealth Records.</p>http://www.rogersanchez.com/ <div id="liveset" class="uitleg"><p>Fan van Roger Sanchez?
