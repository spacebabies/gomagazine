more than a hollow shell", says someone who has found himself at the centre 
of the international techno scene since 2006. Speelt Saturday 19 July op Extrema Outdoor.</p><p><strong> The passionate musician from 
Bremen has become a heavy influence for an awful lot of producers 
worldwide. With his album "Liebe ist..." (&lsquo;Love is...&rsquo;) Stephan Bodzin has 
reached yet another highpoint in his career. <br /><br /> As the son of an experimental musician his career in the music industry was 
set from an early age. And it was only a matter of time before Stephan would 
fall in love with electronic music. Composing music for several prestigious 
European theaters was the first successful platform for his music. <br /><br /> At the same time he discovered his passion for club sounds and  increased 
his efforts in this area. His mind-blowing talent was soon discovered and 
producers such as Oliver Huntemann and Marc Romboy 
queued up to work with Stephan. Due to the quality of his impressive music 
he has reached the top of the international techno scene. Most recently he 
has remixed songs for well-known bands such as Depeche Mode, Booka 
Shade and The Knife. His releases can be found on labels such as Get 
Physical, Datapunk, Gigolo, Systematic and Giant Wheel. <br /><br /> "Throughout my releases and all my collaborations I managed to let my ideas 
flow freely and to develop my own style" Stephan explains. "I understood 
that my personal definition of good and bad music is very dynamic and that's 
why intuition is so important in this business". He describes himself as a 
"melody man" - "after all it's the melodies that endure". The responses to his 
productions seem to confirm this: his sounds are greatly loved in clubs 
worldwide. DJ Hell himself has dubbed Stephan's tunes as the ground 
breaking "Bremen sound". <br /><br /> It was a logical move to create his own label called "Herzblut" in 2006. As 
part of the label-conglomerate Plantage 13 he has found the ideal creative 
framework for his works. <br /> His solos productions have done nothing but raise his worldwide profile even 
more and he now has the freedom of an individual artist with a worldwide 
audience. <br /> "This was a massive step forward", he explains, "I produce music to share it, 
and I can experience this great feeling in each of my gigs". On top of that 
Stephan has created a phenomenal live set that will exclusively be performed 
on his "Liebe ist..." tour.<br /> Stephan's music is as polarizing as he is, both as DJ and live artist. But 
there's one statement that holds true for all of his productions: they are 
certainly of the highest &lsquo;authenticity&rsquo;.<br /><br /> <a href="http://www.stephanbodzin.de/">www.stephanbodzin.de</a></strong></p><div id="liveset" class="uitleg"><p>Fan van Stephan Bodzin?
