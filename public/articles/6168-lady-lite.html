Speelt Wednesday 22 October op Girls on Decks.</p><p> She grew up with only her mother and a little sister. She used to live near a black American base where her mother used to hang out with her friends so her first words were in Dutch and in English. Her favourite music from a child has been black music, especially reggae.  Already in kindergarden she could draw like a 6 year old kid, which is something she inherited from her mother and her father, who used to be a painter. At the age of 8 she decided herself to become a vegetarian. One year later, in 1987 she started her education at the academy for fine arts.</p>   	<p>From 1991 to 1993 she combined her art education with Latin and took some extra courses in theatre.  Than the school councillor gave her the advice to go to a provincial institute for art where she studied plastic arts and architecture for three years. At the age of 15 her life changed entirely. She changed her name, grew her some dreadlocks, pierced her nose herself and started working at a caf&eacute; one day a week, where she learned about different music styles. At this point photographers started to ask her to model for their pictures.  One year later, in 1995, she worked at the legendary germinal techno parties. That&rsquo;s how she started to appreciate electronic music.</p>   	<p>In September 1996, at the age of 17 she decided to go to Li&egrave;ge to study liberal and spatial art. That&rsquo;s how she learned to speak French. Her friends of the squat where she used to go to eat learned her about punk music. One day a week she jammed with djemb&eacute;s together with one of her teachers and some other students. That&rsquo;s how she discovered her feeling for rhythm.  In February 1998 she quitted school due to a lack of interest. To divert her senses she started to get tattooed and pierced and she started to travel around. For one year she shuttled between &lsquo;the not commercialised part of- Ibiza and Belgium. That&rsquo;s how she learned Spanish, she got to know Psychedelic trance music and learned how to live in a commune. She lost herself in parapsychology and still practices it.</p>   	<p>During that time she got to know the Limburger underground organisation Illtown. The man behind the concept is dj Lowdown. They got engaged pretty soon. He made sure she went back to school where she studied industrial product design for two years. Now she has finished her studies. Because of being bored during school, with Spain still in her mind, she looked for some hobbies so she bought a <span class="caps">BMX</span>, took capoeira lessons, learned to spit fire and collaborated with theatre and music performances.</p>   	<p>In February 2000, at the age of 20, she asked Lowdown to show her how dj&rsquo;s mix. Already three months later she started to perform in public. Immediately she became resident of Illtown and the late Four In Trance (4IT), who organised parties at venues like in old mining buildings and in caves in and around Limburg. Her choice of records is very variable. She likes to experiment with less known records that are influenced by black music like ragga, robot voices and female lyrics. For special occasions she was hosted by MC Wolfface from the hip hop posse Rhyme Dealaz.  In January 2001 Lowdown establishes Illtown Rec. which is a music label with techno and electro releases from Locutus, Stanny Franssen aka G-Force, Xentrix and himself. When her productions are ready she will probably produce them on this label.</p>   	<p>From August 2001 until February 2002 she worked at JJ Records in her home town Hasselt. To fill her open hours she decided to took some lessons in sculpture at the academy where she used to go as a kid. That year she was asked to join Muziek-O-Droom and The Zoo to be their resident.</p>   	<p>In January 2002 Mary Jane introduced herself and since March 2002 she hosts her on almost every performance.  At the end of May 2002 she and Lowdown opened their own dj shop Illtown Records. The graffiti policy Jungle Tactics from Limburg has it&rsquo;s office at their shop.</p>http://www.dedkob.com/site/index.php?option=com_akostaff&Itemid=29&func=fullview&staffid=3
