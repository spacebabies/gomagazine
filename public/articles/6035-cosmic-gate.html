	<p>During the trance boom of the late nineties no DJ set would have been complete without the sounds of Cosmic Gate. Original productions such as The Drums, Back To Earth, Exploration of Space, The Truth, Raging and the unforgettable Fire Wire, which reached #9 in the UK charts and dominated DJ record boxes, homes and car stereos across the globe for the majority of the synth filled millennium year.</p>


	<p>In Germany the act have seen unequivocal fame with no less than seven chart top 40 singles to their name along with two artist albums &#8216;Rhythm &#38; Drums&#8217; and &#8216;No more Sleep&#8217; rocketing their way into the album charts.</p>
