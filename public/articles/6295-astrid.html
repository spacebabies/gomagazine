Speelt Saturday 14 February op The First XXL .</p><p> Besides her daily piano lessons, listening to rock, reggae, electro and pop music was a prominent element in here daily routine. She has always been intrigued by elements of different styles and that&#8217;s probably what makes her such a versatile DJ/producer nowa-days. During a short trip to Texel, she was confronted with house music for the first time. She was hooked instantly.</p>


	<p>The minute she got back home, shestarted collecting vinyl, hoping to play in front of an audience someday. She did just that and more&#8230;..</p>


	<p>At the age of nineteen Astrid had to make a very important choice what to do with her musical career. Eventually she decided to devote her life to her music, and her choice has proven to be very successful so far. Nowadays she has found a way to balance her time in the studio, the clubs and at the one-offs. Without a doubt, Astrid is one of the most animated DJ&#8217;s breathing. Her looks, enthusiasm and of course herremarkable talent make her one of the most celebrated DJ&#8217;s in theNetherlands.When she twists behind the decks, she brings the crowd to soaring highs, over and over again. Ever since her debut at the <span class="caps">VIP</span> Club nights in Paradiso, Astrid has put her mark on the Dutch dance scene.

She has rocked the crowds of some of the hottest Dutch clubs, such as Stalker, Nightlive, and the Milky Way. Furthermore, she&#8217;s also a festival/event favourite, as she has rocked the crowds at New Frontier, Mysteryland, Paaspop, Impulz Outdoor, Time Machine and Trance Energy, playing in front of crowds of over 30,000 clubbers. The crowd&#8217;s energy is the driving force for Astrid. Their vibe fuels her mind and the outcome is an outburst of energy that bounces back and forth. In 2001, Astrid launched her fortnightly residency at the renowned <span class="caps">KREMLIN</span> club night, which was nominated by Ministry of Sound as &#8216;Best International Club 2001&#8217;. She quickly found an audience at <span class="caps">KREMLIN</span>.

<p>  Today, there is a food revolution happening and it is not based on food shortages or food security, but rather on the exhilarating connection to the very thing that binds cultures, people and generations.    Despite the fact that, 1 in 3 Americans is obese, and most food found in our super markets, that is not organic, is genetically modiﬁed - there is a metamorphosis in our food culture, happening in the mist of all of this.

<p>Jeg leste to lengre saker om blogging i går, den ene er den som en del av dere sikkert har fått med dere, Veslemøy Agas dykk ned i blondinebloggsfæren i  fredagens D2 ,  Intim bakrus . Den andre var Elin Grelssons essay  Det offentlige terapirummet , i det svenske tidsskriftet  Ord&Bild , Utgave #4:2008. To artikler som behandler det samme, men fra helt forskjellig utgangspunkt.     Skjermdump fra Linnea Myhres blogg    I D2 har Aga snakket med våre norske superbloggere, eller ex-superbloger</p>
