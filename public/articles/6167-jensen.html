Speelt Thursday 23 October op Jensen, Maxim Lany, Yamo.</p><p> A friend took me to a record shop in Ostend where I was able to listen to some stuff. I was very much into hip hop around those days and listened to music by A Tribe Called Quest, Mobb Deep, Sunz Of Man, Blade, etc. </p>

<p>I did not have any turntables of my own, but a friend of mine was in sound equipment rental and let me use his gear during the week. I landed a weekend job and was soon able to start buying vinyl and equipment myself. </p>

<p>I was limited to that one shop to get new vinyl but at least it was a start. A little later I really got into drum’n’bass, which was really close to hip hop anyway. Tracks from Dillinja, Dom&;Ronald always got me going. I spent all of my free time dj’ing in my bedroom in those days. But that was about to change when I met Ya’Mo, a dj who was throwing local parties where he played groove and filtered house. </p>

<p>Those were some serious times! It was only logical I got into house music as well and started mixing things from labels like Euka-Tech, Tango, NRK, etc. I soon got the chance to do a monthly Friday and was able to soak up more of the deeper side of house: Masters At Work, Derrick Carter, DJ Sneak, Kenny Hawkes, etc.</p>

<p> In the summer of 2003 it was time to start setting up my own party called MasterMinds. I invited such Belgian jocks like Moody, Ithai,… Ending things with Raoul and Tino playing the last edition in 2004. During those times I had regular gigs at Voom Voom with people like DJ Pierre from Fuse and DJ Pudde from Music Man Ostend. </p>

<p>September and October 2005 saw me starting to play Mondays at the infamous Decadance in Ghent on their Young Talent Nights. Soon they were booking me on Wednesdays and Fridays to do warm-ups for international dj’s like Kenny Larkin, Darren Roach, Grant Dell, etc. That same year I moved to Ghent and live together with another house enthusiast called DJ Bugsy. We decided to work together and started throwing wild parties at our house, playing 4 decks and inviting people like John Larner, Justin Long, Slater Hogan, etc. </p>

<p>We soon had more people in our home than we could handle and decided to start looking for a bigger venue. We soon found a location and with a little help from our friend Jean (Jack’n’Jazz) we founded What’s Cookin’? During the first editions our night featured guests like Big Hair, Red D &; Lady Lynn, Amir Javasoul and local heroes like Cheez, Jonni Gratts, David Foyh, Ricardo, Yann, etc. We held the night in different locations, from sailing clubs to old warehouses. Bugsy and I had great sets there and really honed our skills we these nights. Right now the night is moving to Vooruit, one of the biggest venues in Ghent. In 2006 I became a resident on Thursdays at Decadance, a residency I’m enjoying till this day. My old friend Ya’Mo and I even have our own little concept called Nasty where we invite such guests like Greenskeepers Live, Trevor Loveys, Troydon &; Jay West. </p>

<p>Finally this year(2007) I also had the pleasure to play at the infamous club H2O in Pecq &; Fuse Club in Brussels and played several times at the Switch Studio's at the famous aroma show hosted by Raoul (Swirl People)and before that on Discover the DJ.</p><div id="liveset" class="uitleg"><p>Fan van Jensen?
