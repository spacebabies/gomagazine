Speelt Saturday 06 September op Laundry Day.</p><p>Milo and Quincy decided to join forces they both had the intention to provide this duo project all the support needed. After many active years in the scene of electronic house music it was almost obvious that Ben and Quincy where destined to join the world of producers, this time as Soul Phønic!</p>


	<p>Since the creation of their own record label Punkid Records, a first successful release was the next move. Besides managing the label both handle a busy booking schedule and monthly residency in Stereo Sushi aka Club Geluk. One of Belgiums most hot and trendy venues situated in Antwerp.</p>


	<p>The idea of Soul Phønic is to combine two different musical approaches into one sound system. Instead of battling, they bring an intensive cooperation, 4 hands, 3 decks, 2 minds, one DJ, thats what Soul Phønic is all about: taking dj-ing up to a new level: always busy, always on the move, seeking for new ways to play and modify these funky and mind blowing rhythms. A duo performance resulting in a musical approach without boundaries. Switching over between house &#38; techno they bring a solid combination of futuristic , minimalistic and elektro house injected vibes always with a deep and funky touch!</p>


	<p>The concept got birth several years ago in Bens studio where they both spent several studio nights resulting in the birth of a few tracks which where frequently played on the (in)famous Rebuilding nights. It was only this winter they both decided to expand this studio project on the dance floor, resulting in a interactive duo performance of both artists.</p>


	<p>However their background goes much further then these few months. 
When we look at the history of Ben&#8217;s musical career, one can hardly call him a freshman. Through the years he played various styles of electronics music and he explored the boundaries of House and Techno. These explorations have made the music Ben plays these days which can be best described as a blend of House, mixed with a touch of minimal, add a flavour of Electro, this with a Tech feeling. Shake well and you have got the recipe for mind-blowing sets. (www.benmilo.com)</p>


	<p>Quincy got his kick-off back in 97 with several respected residencies and gigs all over Belgium. Not to forget his monthly performances together with Ben Milo at the legendary Boccaccio in Destelbergen where they both established a solid reputation in the progressive house scene.
Running the online shop, the label and the agency (Punkid Representation) makes Quincy nowadays a full time music promoter in the scene of alternative electronic house music! (www.djquincy.com)</p>


	<p>In short notice Soul Phønic established to a busy schedule with several guest performances and a monthly residency in Antwerps most hot and trendy venue, Stereo Sushi (aka Club Geluk). Together with dj Prinz (café danvers) and several international guests such as dj F.E.X., Jesse Rose, Jan Van Biesen, Break 3000, Phonique and many more to come!</p>


	<p>On a production level Soul Phønic is responsible for the very first Punkid Records release, Dirty Plague EP. This release is also worldwide available for legal download through Beatport and Tunetribe. Future releases includes the remix for the El Futuro EP by Josh Lasden &#38; Synoptic, remix work for Dj Prinz (café danvers, strike records) and also a second Soul Phønic EP coming up January 2006!</p>


	<p>Currently Quincy and Ben Milo both handle the management of the record label, Punkid Records.</p>http://www.punkidrecords.com/
