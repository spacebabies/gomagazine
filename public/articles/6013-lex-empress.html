Speelt Saturday 02 August op Loveland Festival.</p><p> She sang in a choir for ten years before taking classes in classical music and later in jazz. By the age of only eight years old, she started to write poetry and lyrics. From the age of 18 she started to sing in bands. She finished a drama study and played small parts in Dutch TV series. She combined all this with modelling she started with at age of 14. In 1998 her outstanding voice got noticed in the underground scene. Being a soulful improviser using her melodious lyrics in various languages she worked as a vocalist with several (inter)national deejays. In the mean time she started recording her vocals with various producers.</p>


	<p>Style
Living in Brazil (Rio de Janeiro), Italy, Spain, The Netherlands and now Bali, she got the chance to meet other cultures and created new skills in singing (and dancing!). Lex Empress now improvises at several music styles singing Italian, Portuguese, Spanish or English which makes her very popular around the world. She is not just an MC of host of the night, but due to her knowledge of music and people she can work the crowd very well and create an unique vibe during every club night.</p>


	<p>National-highlights
With past residencies at the most popular clubs in Holland like &#8216;Las Palmas&#8217; in Rotterdam, &#8216;Panama&#8217; and &#8216;Hotel Arena&#8217;in Amsterdam she is singing every month with well known international deejays. Lex performed at several Dutch festivals and events over the last 6 years like Extrema Outdoor, Beachbop, Islander, just to name a few. She is now resident at the infamous Hed Kandi and Funk&#8217;d events. In 2005/2006 she is also on stage in over 30 theaters with the populair jazz-dance show &#8216;Interpretationzz&#8217;.</p>


	<p>International highlights
Lex already started saving frequently flying miles at an early stage visiting Rio de Janeiro, Vienna, Barcelona, Zurich, Rome, London, Shanghai, Cannes, Dubai, New York, Miami, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta and plenty of other cities we cannot describe here. Her recent popularity in South East Asia is rising after her successful performances in club Zouk (Singapore/Kuala Lumpur) and several clubs in Jakarta and Bali. Even China invites Lex Empress for an extended tour this year.</p>

	<p>Discography
A studio in Italy convinced her in 1998 to record a song in Parma, which became the song &#8216;give it up&#8217; at Positiva Records, very well received by the Italian dance scene. Since then Lex Empress gave her voice to several house tracks (like 16 Bit Lolita&#8217;s) and is working with different (inter)national producers like respected producer Sven van Hees who released his new album &#8220;Synesthesia&#8221; in June 2005. Lex Empress wrote 2 songs for his album and the first release &#8220;The Sun Goes Down&#8221; turned into a summer hit. The fantastic video taken in Bali is rotated at <span class="caps">MTV</span>. Her latest signing is at Soulfuric Records with a new record with Born2Funk to be released at <span class="caps">WMC 2006</span> in Miami. For her live project with The Royals she write songs in another style which is more jazzy, soulful or latin orientated.  Check our website.</p>http://www.amsbookings.com/

<p>This is really big week that was created by the shortage of books from last week. It would have been over 30 books anyway, but now it is an insane week.  A VERY BIG THANK YOU TO GWEN! YEAH – We now have a logo and if all goes well – I won’t say anything about why we have a logo until I know it is a done deal. Gwen did a great job (and yes as a proud parent my opinion may be skewed, but it is not) and put a lot of work into the design. Also thanks to William Katt and Chris Folino for their genero</p>
