Speelt Wednesday 31 December op Erotic New Years Vibe.</p><p> Hij begon zijn muzikale carrière als DJ op illegale radiostations in Amsterdam en presenteerde met Fred Berkhout op Radio 100 de show &#8216;Acid Explosion&#8217; wat later de naam &#8216;Grooveyard&#8217; kreeg. Samen met The Prophet, Buzz Fuzz en Gizmo vormt hij begin jaren &#8216;90 &#8216;The Dreamteam&#8217; en staat vanaf dat moment op bijna ieder Hardcore-feest van belang in binnen- en buitenland. Na een periode van stilte rondom Dano heeft hij eindelijk zijn oude vorm terug en wordt weer volop geboekt op de grote evenementen.</p>

	<p>Not every DJ is being addressed as God by his fans.  People that name their child after a DJ aren&#8217;t found much either.  The citizen of Amsterdam Dano &#8217; also known as Daniël Leeflang &#8217; has had the honour to experience both several times, which demonstrates that his popularity has reached unprecedented forms.  Two decades ago the living legend couldn&#8217;t comprehend that he would turn out to be one of the biggest names of the harder dance styles.  After he started working as a DJ for several Amsterdam radio pirates in 1984, he became a journalist for the metropolitan paper &#8216;Nieuws van de dag&#8217; &#8217; News of the Day &#8217; in 1987.  Armed with pen and paper he rambles through nocturnal Amsterdam and finds the Roxy club on his path. It is here that house pioneer Eddy the Clercq infects him with the acidvirus. &#8216;After my second visit at the Roxy I was hooked for life and knew that electronic music was my vocation.&#8217; In 1989, Dano has his own radio show at the local radio station Radio 100 with Freddy B. called &#8216;Acid Explosion&#8217;. A year later he became a resident DJ in club Mazzo.</p>


	<p>Although Dano is an eagerly seen guest in the underground dance scene in 1990 and 1991, his big-scale breakthrough is in 1992.  In the exhibition centre of Utrecht, he plays the decks side by side with his colleagues Buzz Fuzz, Gizmo and Prophet at a mega party. The legendary Dreamteam was born.  The party also marks the beginning of the explosive rise of hardcore and, within a short period, Leeflang grows out to be one of the headmen of the scene.  The years that follow can best be described as a mad roller coaster-ride that leads him along all large national and international hardcore-parties at top speed.  Except showing his skills at all the huge, Dutch parties like Hellraiser, Thunderdome and Mystery Land he&#8217;s also one of the headliners of German events like Mayday and the Love Parade and is travelling to all the far corners of the world.  &#8216;The Australian tour with the Dreamteam is without a doubt one of the most beautiful moments of my career.  I will never forget the mutual friendship, the beautiful landscape and the frenzied public.&#8217;</p>


	<p>In the 90&#8217;s, Dano is not only chosen as best hardcore-DJ four times; he&#8217;s also the instigator of an ever-growing list of mix-compilations.  Dano&#8217;s producing for several record-labels like Mokum, ID&#38;T, Fuckem, Dreamteam Productions and his tracks show up at dozens of well known and lesser-known hardcore-compilations. Besides working as a DJ and producer, Dano is a creditable remixer. One of the most important weapon facts of the latter is the &#8216;T-1000&#8217; rearrangement for the metal band Fear Factory.  Up to now, the most remarkable project of his career is without a doubt the cooperation with the passed away musician/peoples hero/artist Herman Brood. He hopes to see the results of this cooperation on vinyl in the near future. Leeflang about other projects: &#8216;In 2004 I mixed a &#8216;Bounzz&#8217; cd and made the second part in the series &#8216;The History Or Hardcore&#8217; as one of the Dreamteam-members.  This year I&#8217;ll undoubtedly dive into the studio again to produce new hardcore.&#8217;</p>


	<p>Between everything that eats and breaths hardcore, Leeflang doesn&#8217;t neglect his other loves &#8217; techno and acid &#8217; and produces three acid tracks for the Lower East Side records together with the New York based Nico and Dylan Hermelijn.  In the year 2000 he releases five slices of vinyl with KC for his own <span class="caps">TPF</span> Records and he works together with Damian Keane.  In 2004 his latest cooperation was with his friend, respected techno-producer and fellow CB-Bookings artist K.D. Smith. It resulted among others in the track &#8216;Aladdin on Acid&#8217;. With the rise of the label Detox, under the inspiring leadership of Fred Berkhout (Mokum Records and Go Bang!), Dano shows his versatility with an excellent mix-album and a number of top of the bill productions.  In the summer of 2004 there was a huge party to celebrate the fact that Dano had been behind the wheels of steel for a staggering 20 years and it&#8217;s most likely that he&#8217;s heading for at least another 20!  &#8216;I must say that I lost most of my motivation to go on when the creativity of the hardcore scene reached an all time low at the end of the 90&#8217;s.  At the present however, the scene blossoms again and is thriving as never before. I feel that the passion I&#8217;ve lost for a while is running through my veins again.&#8217;</p><div id="liveset" class="uitleg"><p>Fan van Dano?
