Raised up in Grimmen at the Baltic Sea, he got into the fascinating groove of Berlin back in the days. A lot of clubs, a lot of new vibes, everybody was mad about the new sonic revolution. He started producing electronic music with cheap instruments, Joey Beltram and Synewave were major influences for him at that time.</p><p>And then he was thrown into the scene totally randomly, performing his first live gig at the Tresor Club in Berlin. He got in contact with Pacou and Sender Berlin and it didnt take much time to release his first track on Proton Records in 1999. In the same year, Alex did his live debut with Stassy from Sender Berlin as the gorgeous techno team Double X. 2001 became a big milestone for Kowalski.</p><p>He released his much acclaimed debut record Echoes on Kanzleramt label, which moved to Berlin a year ago, and quickly produced his follow up Progress, released at the beginning of 2002. While Echoes was the first shout out to the world of electronic music, Progress pushed him up several levels, opening a totally new and unexplored path through the clubs and cultures of this 2002 world.</p><p>A year and a half after his breakthrough second album he released Response, sending us Belo Horizonte one of he most beautiful sonic postcards we ever heard. But then it was time to take a deep breath from the hype he had created with his sound, just doing remixes and travelling the world without the pressure of doing another album so quickly.</p><p>During these tremendous years, he had gained several titles as best producer, best live act and was nominated twice for the German dance award in 2003. After a break of almost three years Alex hits the nail with Changes. True, he cant hide the changes that happened to him and we are invited to hear that. A more intense live show has made Alex an international top live act, not just providing dry techno tracks for the dancefloor, but presenting real songs with soul, breaks and charming vocals, that makes everyone of his shows a unique performance.</p><p>Time has changed and so has Alex. He switched from Kanzleramt to Different, where he found a new home for his new musical direction. I feel like I have learned so much in the last few years and that my producing skills have become a lot better than in the rough days of Echoes, says Alex. With every record Kowalski has shapened his sound of what a good electronic piece of music should be about.</p><p>His vision has moved towards more vocals and Alex has become a real teamplayer. Meanwhile still experiencing a harder and rougher side in his side project Double X, his passion for vocals was, and still is growing more and more. Alex is curious about what this trip into the context of House, Techno, Pop and Vocals will show up in the future.</p><p>He found some friends on his new journey, that would make his vision come true. There is Khan from Cpt. Comatose, who puts in a little human factor into Kowalskis sound with his unmistakable voice on House of Hell. And there is Fritz Kalkbrenner, a young Berlin rascal, whose beautiful voice has been heard on tracks by Sascha Funke, laying his voice on a few tracks on Changes. But also Funk DVoid and Joris Voorn have crossed Alexs path, enriching his tracks with their warm sound.</p><p>Since the beginning, I wanted to experiment with vocals. More and more, this has become a passion and with my new album I have achieved a level that brings me even closer to the sound I always wanted. Face the fact: Changes is more Kowalski than ever. Enjoy it.</p><p>Fan van Alexander Kowalski?
