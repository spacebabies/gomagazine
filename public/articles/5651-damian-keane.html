Speelt Saturday 26 January op Awakenings.</p><p> In 1988 his mother moved back to England and it was here that he discovered electronical music through mixtapes. He soon started buying vinyl, at first his interest went out to stuff on Kickin, Production House, Reinforced and Plus 8 amongst others. Later on he was influenced by dj&#8217;s/producers on labels such as ltj Bukem&#8217;s Goodlooking imprint, Dee Jay Recordings and the emerging sound of drum &#38; bass.</p>


	<p>From 1993 he started to visit London on a regular basis and got into techno which was very popular in this city at the time. After visiting clubs like the Soundshaft and events as Megatripolis he got into pumping English, German and American techno on labels like , Proper, Tresor, Internal and Axis.
These early years have really shaped his taste and it is the energy and the typical sound of this era complemented with the deep and somewhat industrial techno produced in the late nineties which is allways present in his sets. These sets are a crossover between English and American techno which make them into a unique experience, an algamation of the best techno produced over the last 15 years.</p>


	<p>Damian is a versatile dj who isn&#8217;t shy to play the more abstract and deeper sounds too, he allways lets the environement, improvisation, the crowd and timeslot be the guiding factors in how he comprises his sets. This versatility has earned him a solid reputation within the Dutch techno scene resulting in gigs all over Holland where he is a household name. besides playing at Traffic, Lowlands, Integrate, Effenaar, 013, Nighttown, Simplon and virtually everything in between Damian has also been dj-ing at the renowned Awakenings parties on a regular basis since 2001. He has also played in Hungary and Poland (Instytut Energetyki, Globopolis, W5, Inqubator, <span class="caps">DNA</span>, Kanty, Sfinx to name a few). The sound he plays is best described as being a reflection of 15 years of techno resulting in a versatile set of old school sounding deep bass/subdriven, sometimes dubby, atmospheric layered techno with a hint of industialism accompanied by &#8220;mid nineties sounding&#8221; dark electronic (synth) sounds.</p>


	<p>In 1999 he teamed up with Eddy Kreischer and Dave Miller to form Eclectronic. In 2001 Sicco Bosscher joined the group and the four of them founded the Audiosculpture imprint. Sculpturism was born and together they are responisble for a number of releases which have seen huge international support. In 2002 Audiosculpture joined the Phonocult group. Audiosculpture often apears on playlists/charts by dj&#8217;s such as Steve Rachmad, Dave Clarke, Laurent Garnier, Cari Lekebusch, Adam Beyer, DJ Rush, Mis Djax, Joel Mull, Petar Dundov and many many more.</p>
