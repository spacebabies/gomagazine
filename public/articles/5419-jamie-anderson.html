Four tracks,Back Then with its highly charged electro house fusion, Open Your Mind that is a hypnotic acidic paranoid trip Food For Thought that drags your arse over to Detroit, slaps you around a bit and then sends you home in a states and then the deep and minimalMore Or Less that leaves you wondering. Welcome Fixia, there is always room for new quality labels on any scene!</p>


	<p>Having had a strong   musical upbringing it was in 1989, after moving from London, that he first   began his musical journey with keyboard training from renowned jazz musician   Dave Buxton.  Inspired by hip-hop and   the boom of the early 90s acid house club scene Jamie soon took to the decks,   promoting parties and performing regularly at club nights locally and in   Europe.</p>


	<p>By 1997, with an ever-increasing   stockpile of music, Artform Records was put on the map as Jamie gave himself   a platform for releasing his productions.    Recognition soon followed with the likes of Dave Angel and Steve   Rachmad remixing his early material and the legendary Orlando Voorn   commissioning work for his Slam Dunk label. </p>


	<p>Two years and   several Artform releases later, Jamie commenced the &#8216;Abstract Latinism&#8217;   series; a ground breaking fusion of latino influenced house and techno   rhythms, propelling his work to the attention of a much wider audience and   inspiring a generation of producers. With attention and acclaim from a   variety of DJs such as Carl Cox, Sneak, Darren Emerson and Giles Peterson.   The releases proved to be a milestone for him.</p>


	<p>Having built upon   his sound, the last two years have seen Jamie&#8217;s work flourish resulting in   him producing some of his strongest material to date. Notably his massive   remixes of Twisted Pair&#8217;s &#8216;Horny Hustle&#8217; and Nick Holder&#8217;s &#8216;Inside Your Soul&#8217;   as well as the release of his &#8216;Black Sun&#8217; single on the much respected   Bristol based <span class="caps">NRK</span> label, won himself many new followers across the globe   Jamie has been able to straddle and influence the gap between house and   techno with ease.</p>http://www.deejaybooking.com/
