Speelt Friday 31 October op Sexy Bag.</p><p> Toen hij genoeg geld had gespaard voor de tweede begon hij gelijk zoveel mogelijk te oefenen met draaien, zowel thuis als op feesten. Hoewel hij in het begin vooral hip hop en r ‘n b draaide, merkte hij dat vooral dancehall bij het publiek aansloeg. Hierin is hij zich verder gaan specialiseren.</p>


	<p>English biography:</p>


	<p>Dj WaxFiend started to listen to music at a young age, at that time mostly HipHop and R&#38;B. He was fascinated by the dj&#8217;s he heard mixing on the radio and at the clubs. After experimenting with tape-decks and his computer he bought his first turntable and mixer at the age of 16 (the 2nd turntable followed after he saved enough money) and started practicing on his mixing and scratching skills. He started playing at every school party, hangout, café or coffeeshop where he had a chance. The audience and other dj&#8217;s appreciated his style which led to some gigs in some bigger clubs.</p>


	<p>What was remarkable about Waxfiend&#8217;s style is that he combined HipHop (from mainstream to old school to underground) with Dancehall and R&#38;B. He noticed a lot of people especially liked the dancehall he was playing so he decided to do a strictly dancehall mixtape. The mixtape spread quickly through the whole of Holland and this really helped him get his name out. Because of this mixtape he met more well known dj&#8217;s and promoters, what led to more gigs in bigger clubs. Together with Dj Poison and Dj Qlick he formed the X-Rated Crew and they made 2 mixcd&#8217;s together. In no time Waxfiend was playing at well known clubs and venues like: Melkweg, Patronaat, Duivel, Kade, Mazzo and more. He was playing at all kind of partie: R&#38;B parties, Dancehall / Reggae parties, HipHop parties, Old School parties.</p>


	<p>Last year Dj WaxFiend has been working non-stop on entertaining people at these parties and making mixcd&#8217;s. At this time he&#8217;s one of the few (maybe the only) Dutch Dj who drops mixcd&#8217;s regularly, and a lot of people in Holland know him from his mixcd series which always feature a selection of the hottest and newest HipHop, Dancehall and R&#38;B. Because Waxfiend is one of the few urban dj&#8217;s in Holland who has been following dancehall music for a longer time and knows how to play real dancehall music for different crowds he is known as the &#8216;Dancehall Specialist&#8217;. But during a Waxfiend set you&#8217;ll hear all kinds of music in the mix. Because of this diversity Waxfiend can entertain different crowds whether they are into HipHop, Reggae, Pop, House, Classics, Dancehall, R&#38;B, Swingbeat, funk, disco, soca, latin, jungle or soul; Waxfiend plays for everyone! His diversity and unique, energetic mixing style and the extra attention for Dancehall music sets him apart from other Dj&#8217;s.</p>


	<p>Nowadays Dj WaxFiend has released over 10 mixcd&#8217;s. He opened for acts like; Sean Paul, Craig David, T.O.K., Jagged Edge, Wu-Tang Killabeez, B2k and more an played with dj&#8217;s like Dj Kool and Jazzy Jeff.</p>


	<p>Besides doing parties he has made music mixes for national TV-and radioshows and recorded exclusive tracks with artists like Elephant Man, T.O.K., Sean Paul and Mr. Vegas.</p>


	<p>Right now Dj WaxFiend belongs to the well known Dj&#8217;s in Holland, he has played at most of the important clubs and parties and if we see how fast he accomplished all of this there&#8217;s a lot we can expect from this young talented Dj.</p>http://www.djwaxfiend.com/
