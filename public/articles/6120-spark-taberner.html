Speelt Saturday 27 September op Fataal.</p>                           <br />                         In the early 90&#39;s he moved together with his mother to Holland after his parents divorced. <br /> After years of playing around with tapedecks, keyboards and other stuff he get infected with the first electronic house sound that came in Holland. Surprised and intrigued, Spark was impressed with this sound.                                                                  <p>He found his way through the music and on his 10th birthday he started to play with decks and a mixer. His friends in his neighbourhood gave him the nickname: Spark. After 4 years of playing hardcore and gabba music he realized that this was not the sound that he was looking for. He went more and more interested in expirimental and dark sounds, he started with playing techno. </p>                           <p>During performances, Spark&#39;s preferred musical palate consists of three decks, CD players and EFX. Always pushing the limits and combining dark, industrial, expirimental sounds with hard and running beats during performances. During his performances it&#39;s typical to see him grabbing, twisting and manipulating clusters of knobs buttons and faders, all precisely moved, concentrated and always trying to expiriment. </p>                         <p>Nowadays when not on the road, he&#39;s either mining beats in his studio or diligently searching for new materials in record shops. His productions span the arenas of dark, industrial, filthy, broken and running beats. With his own imprint &quot;Mechanized Records&quot; he wants to present the darker site of techno. </p>                         <p>Together with his co-producer Oliver Clothesoff he did releases on well known labels as Systemcalls, Crowbar, Tekktribe, Fat.Tm, Friendly Fire e.a. With their own tracks they are compilated on different cd&#39;s. </p>                         <p>He brought his sound in several country&#39;s like Germany, Spain, Greece, Belgium, Austria, Malta, England, Slovakia to name a few.</p><p><a href="http://www.sparktaberner.com/">www.sparktaberner.com</a>&nbsp;</p><div id="liveset" class="uitleg"><p>Fan van Spark Taberner?
