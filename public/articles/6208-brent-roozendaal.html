Speelt Friday 21 November op Minimaal Feestmaal.</p><p> He got inspired during his teen years by his uncle, a classic house DJ, who took him to several underground parties in Germany. 2000 was the year when Mood Engineering showed up on the scene, a collaboration between Brent and his close friend Pitto. In the beginning they both performed as DJs all over the country and during the years started to develop and refine their skills. By organizing several quality concepts in well established clubs such as Paradiso (Amsterdam) and Doornroosje (Nijmegen) they built up a reputation of being original and always giving their own personal touch to these special evenings.</p>   	<p>Mood Engineering recently celebrated its fifth anniversary during which they looked back at 5 successful years and also looked towards the future. As the driving force behind the successful Drift parties in Doornroosje and as co-organizer and resident of Mood Elevator, things are looking good for the future. Playing with the likes of Jeff Mills, Laurent Garnier, Josh Wink and several other international stars raised his DJ career to a higher level. He quickly picked up different techniques and styles which improved his performance considerably. Brent is inspired by many styles and could be described as quite an unique type of DJ, not limiting himself to one type of music. It is especially because of this reason that has made him quite a versatile house DJ.</p>   	<p>Brent started producing his own material during 2004 and his creativity lead to quite some people being interested in his music. The first Mood Engineering release will be a fact in March 2007, when they will release &lsquo;This Mood Engeneering ï¿½&rdquo; trust ep&rsquo; on Sound Architecture records. Recently he also teamed up with his new musical soulmate, Aron Friedman. Under their Mesjokked DJs moniker they have been know to play long epic sets. The coming year they&rsquo;ll bombard Holland with their crazy pumping and unique sounds. Together with Aron Friedman and Carlos Valdes he also started a new concept called Crackhouse. This concept should fill the gab between techno and minimal. 2007 will become a promising year&hellip;</p>   	<p>Besides all of this Brent started a new project in which he is teaching culture at primary schools. He will graduate from his history course at university and will become a part time teacher in history.</p>   	<p>Some references: doornroosje, paradiso, club moog (barcelona), ruigoordkerk, lovefield festival (hamburg), melkweg, studio80, decadance (gent), sugar factory, atak, burgerweeshuis, azijnfabriek, fast forward parade, twstd, zementgarden (berlin), bootleg, club rotterdam, de rechter, plan c, inferno, old cave, poema, ekko, more to come&hellip;</p>http://www.moodengineering.com/ <div id="liveset" class="uitleg"><p>Fan van Brent Roozendaal?
