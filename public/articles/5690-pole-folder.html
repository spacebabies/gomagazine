Speelt Friday 25 January op Hush Clubbing / Peoples.</p><p> As Benoit grew, so did his musical diversity and at the age of 15 he discovered rock music, channelling his musical energies into rock bands and by the age of 18 he had formed his first band, &#8216;Dirty Slip&#8217; where he added song writing and to his fast growing repertoire, further band ventures seeing him play live and tour around his home country of Belgium.</p>


	<p>Not one to rest on his laurels, Benoit soon became influenced by the thriving techno scene being developed between clubs like Le Boccaccio and La Rocca, becoming influenced by the electronic sounds made famous at these venues, which pushed him into a direction utilising electronic sequencers. Ever curious, Benoit wanted to push this curiosity further and with long time friend Alain Bultot, they set up a professional studio where their group Ragged Life was formed.</p>


	<p>Several tracks were created, the most notable of which, &#8216;I&#8217;ll Be Right Here&#8217; becoming a massive anthem in the Belgium club scene and grabbing the attention of Sony Records Benelux, who realising the untapped potential that Benoit had, signed not only the track, but Benoit himself to a publishing deal, which quickly developed into a production role for many artists that Sony were dealing with. One of his first production jobs for Sony was in co-operation with an artist called Petra on the track &#8216;Angel&#8217; which became an underground club anthem once more.</p>


	<p>Benoit was also in tune with the fast rising global dance scene and after discovering the sounds of DJs Sasha and John Digweed soon moved into a deeper direction under the name of Pole Folder. His first release, Apollo Vibes, was quickly signed to John Digweed&#8217;s record label, Bedrock and since then two further singles have been released, in addition to the &#8216;Moon In A Blue Sky EP&#8217; on Sunkissed Records. John Digweed, researching all of Benoit&#8217;s work over the years soon signed Benoit up to an album deal, one of few artists to be offered a deal on the Bedrock imprint, and now the next chapter in the career of Benoit Franquet is about to unfold as he works towards creating an artist album, a venture that within the sometimes restrictive world of dance music looks set to rewrite the rules.</p><div id="liveset" class="uitleg"><p>Fan van Pole Folder?
